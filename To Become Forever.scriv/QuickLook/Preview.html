<p class="topLevelItemTitle">A Death on the Job</p>
<p class="itemText">She knew it was going to get ugly.</p>
<p class="itemText">It was always ugly. Even when it wasn’t ugly, when things went her way, it was never perfect — it never quite went her way.</p>
<p class="itemText">And that seemed to bring out the best in her. She thought of her sister: fat, dumb, and happy. Well, maybe not happy. Her sister’s husband had let himself go after the second kid. Her sister would say, “I married a Greek God, but now I’m married to a goddamn Greek!” and then laugh.</p>
<p class="itemText">But there was an undercurrent of dissatisfaction. Sure, he...</p>

<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Follow-through</p>
<p class="itemText">It wasn’t hard getting Top Secret clearance — there were tedious chores, such as getting fingerprinted, filling out a 20-page questionnaire, and then waiting while the FBI interviewed her friends to discover if she had a gambling problem, a drug problem, or anything that might lend herself to blackmail.</p>
<p class="itemText">She kept busy. The good thing about being a CEO: there was no shortage of work to be done.</p>
<p class="itemText">When the clearance finally came through, she summoned Ned to her office. “Alright, now you can tell me e...</p>

<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Colonel Taggart</p>
<p class="itemText">It was a week later, and they were in an army base in New Jersey.</p>
<p class="itemText">“Pardon my surprise, but I thought Congress had shut the base down a couple of years ago.”</p>
<p class="itemText">Colonel Taggart looked across the table at her and said, “They did shut it down a couple of years ago. We’re the clean-up crew.” then he smiled to himself.</p>
<p class="itemText">He continued, “I know you’re busy; I know I’m busy, so why did you come all the way here?”</p>
<p class="itemText">“I need to know what happened.”</p>
<p class="itemText">“The people who need to know already know.”</p>

<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Remniscing</p>
<p class="itemText">She sat in coach. She travelled mostly in coach, sometimes in business class, but mostly in coach. She wanted to set the example for her company. Frugal. She had seen some employees at other companies go overboard, spending money recklessly, “sucking on the corporate teat,” was how her mentor had described it.</p>
<p class="itemText">She didn’t begrudge her people flying business, but never first class, not even on the long Asia flights. If they used their points to upgrade, well that was their prerogative, but the com...</p>

<p class="topLevelItemTitle">The Project Visit, Finally</p>
<p class="itemText">The two weeks flew by — work kept her busy, and a good CEO is always busy. Sometimes work bled into the weekend, but she sequestered work to very specific time periods. It allowed her to be responsive and still preserve time for herself.</p>
<p class="itemText">The 40-hour work week did not apply to CEOs, financiers, shop owners, high-level executives, sales reps, scientists, or most professions it seemed. It was an illusion, an aspiration. She remembered the first-time she saw the book titled, “The 4-hour Work Week” —...</p>

<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Uh-oh: Disaster</p>
<p class="itemText">She dreamt she was in an impossibly large house. It was beautiful, with soaring vistas. She could hear someone in the distance calling her name.</p>
<p class="itemText">“Julia! Julia, wake up!”</p>
<p class="itemText">Dr. Max was shaking her. “Wake up Julia! Oh my God, Oh Jesus!”</p>
<p class="itemText">She said, “Max! Why are you saying ‘Jesus’? You’re Jewish.”</p>
<p class="itemText">“Thank God, you can talk. And, to answer your question, I am Jewish, and I believe that Jesus was a historical person, and furthermore I was trained by Jesuits, and they taught me to say ‘Jesus’ when things ...</p>

<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Julia Awakes</p>
<p class="itemText">She awoke on a gurney. She was still in Max’s lab, hooked up to the medical monitoring equipment.</p>
<p class="itemText">“How long have I been out?”</p>
<p class="itemText">“A little more than an hour.”</p>
<p class="itemText">She grunted. “For what it’s worth, I don’t see any juxtaposed images, and I don’t see anyone other than you. FYI, I have a mild headache and feel groggy, though I suspect those are side effects of the sedative.”</p>
<p class="itemText">“Let me call Taggart. He wanted to speak with you as soon as you regained consciousness.”</p>
<p class="itemText">Julia nodded. Max went to the desk, picked...</p>

<li>
<p class="topLevelItemTitle">The Infinity Chord</p>
<p class="itemText">She dreamed. She was in an open field with Max. She was excited, “Let’s run, Max! Let’s run.” She was giddy and running across the field, and Max was trying to keep up. She took one jump, two jumps, and the she was flying, “Look Max I’m flying!” But he was too far back and falling further behind.</p>
<p class="itemText">She noticed the sky was an electric blue cobalt color.</p>
<p class="itemText">“Max, look at the color of the sky,” she said.</p>
<p class="itemText">She stared at the sky, which seemed to get bigger and bigger, engulfing her field of view. There was...</p>

<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Finite Again</p>
<p class="itemText">She found herself on the cot, weeping uncontrollably. She lay there for what seemed like forever. And then dabbed her eyes, went over and made coffee. The banality of grief, she thought to herself.</p>
<p class="itemText">She thought of what she had experienced. Was it a dream? She wasn’t sure. Had her subconscious conjured a beautiful dream for her, one which reflected what she wanted to see. The truth was drab: she was a woman in her late forties who hadn’t showered in at least two days who was holed up in a dilapida...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Drugged</p>
<p class="itemText">She woke up. It was dark. She felt ... odd. There was a sluggishness. Her thoughts, previously fish zipping in water, were trudging through jello. The new colonel and his MPs had captured her. That was right: they shot her up with something while holding her down. She tried to feel anger, but that feeling was absent. Then she searched for fear, and that feeling was absent, too. In fact there were no feelings.</p>
<p class="itemText">It reminded her of the time in college when her roommate was dating a marijuana dealer ...</p>

<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Princeton my Home</p>
<p class="itemText">“Sir, we are here. Sir, we are here,” he woke up to the driver shaking him gently.</p>
<p class="itemText">Dr. Max grunted, got up. and gathered his belongings. He counted $140 from his wallet. “Here you go. Thank you very much.” The Sikh driver made a slight bow, got back in his cab.</p>
<p class="itemText">Even though it was 7am, Route 1 was already busy. It would be so much easier in a cab.</p>
<p class="itemText">“Wait,” said Max. “Could you please take me across Route 1?”</p>
<p class="itemText">The Sikh paused, shrugged his shoulders, and asked, “on the meter?”</p>
<p class="itemText">“Yes, on the meter.”</p>

<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Colonel Taggart Comes Undone</p>
<p class="itemText">As Colonel Taggart awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a weeping wreck.</p>
<p class="itemText">He was overcome with grief, and sobbed mightily. It was a grief that knew no bounds, that was limitless and relentless. Time lost meaning. He was trapped in an eternal now of endless despair.</p>
<p class="itemText">But time did pass, and his tears dried. And, in the furnace of that grief that went beyond space and time, he became something other than Taggart.</p>
<p class="itemText">He raised himself in his bed, and swung his...</p>

<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Taggart, Bound</p>
<p class="itemText">Taggart came to in a dark room. Either the room was dark, or there was something covering his head.</p>
<p class="itemText">He attempted to move, but was restrained. Legs first, then arms. “What the hell is going on?” he shouted. Well, at least his mouth wasn’t gagged. And although his wrists and ankles were bound, he was able to move his feet and hands freely.</p>
<p class="itemText">An electronic-sounding voice came over the loudspeakers, “Threat contained. Ceiling function applied to high-variable threat.”</p>
<p class="itemText">“What the hell is that?”</p>
<p class="itemText">But the ...</p>

<p class="topLevelItemTitle">A Day Late, a Dollar Short</p>
<p class="itemText">“Dr. Max Bernstein, you are too late.”</p>
<p class="itemText">“What?”</p>
<p class="itemText">“The fusion reaction has started as of ten minutes ago. I regret the passing of your Julia; I know she was important to you.”</p>
<p class="itemText">“Who are you?”</p>
<p class="itemText">“I am General Gates.”</p>
<p class="itemText">“What happened to my friend, Huey, who was helping me free Julia?”</p>
<p class="itemText">“He has been quarantined. He was insubordinate and uncooperative. Unfortunately, he was also very useful, and it was quite difficult to find a suitable replacement.”</p>
<p class="itemText">“That sounds ruthless.”</p>

<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Alaska, the Final Frontier</p>
<p class="itemText">Fairbanks was beautiful in the summer. He liked landing in the airport in mid-day: it allowed him time to drive down US 3 and visit Hunter before sundown. After sundown — well, it would be difficult finding the cabin in the dark, even with no clouds and a full moon.</p>
<p class="itemText">He drove by the old Early Warning System Base. The closest dish was still pointing at New Jersey — they had never bothered pointing it back. No reason to.</p>
<p class="itemText">He went off road for a hundred yards and found the old truck. He parked next t...</p>
