## Death and the Devil

Azrael looked over the flat gray horizon. There was nothing to see. Only Azrael himself. He stood staring east. Few passed by him. Those that did come by thought that he was some strange statue left by some forgotten civilization. Azrael never moved, and only the oldest of creatures remembered the forbidding angel of death.

One day Michael flew by. &ldquo;Azrael, we need you. Lucifer is storming the gates of heaven with his legions of Hell. We need help.&rdquo;

Azrael did not move. Michael stood in front of him. Michael touched him on the cheek. Michael&rsquo;s face, achingly beautiful, hardened. Azrael still did not move.

&ldquo;So be it, Azrael. So be it.&rdquo;

Michael flew away. Azrael stared straight ahead.

And thus the walls of heaven were stormed.

An eternity passed. Lucifer ruled from the gates of heaven, and the nights were split with light, for Lucifer was, after all, the lord of light.

And all had forgotten Azrael.

And Lucifer, the lord of Hell, one day came across Azrael.

&ldquo;You are no statue,&rdquo; he said, staring at Azrael.

Azrael did not move. Azrael only stared ahead.

&ldquo;You are a creature. I know all creatures in this realm; how is it that I do not know you?&rdquo;

Azrael did not move.

Lucifer did not move either. Lucifer stared at Azrael. Azrael stared straight ahead, his gaze never wavering from the east.

&ldquo;Oh quiet one, time moves so slowly here. We will find you out. There is nowhere to run, and there is nowhere to hide. Let us converse.&rdquo;

Azrael did not move. Lucifer smiled, &ldquo;Very well. You are only making things difficult for yourself.&rdquo;

Lucifer left.

Days later a winged creature flew to Azrael. &ldquo;I am the dark angel.&rdquo;

Azrael did not move.

&ldquo;I will take you to Lucifer.&rdquo;

The dark angel was strong. Few in the land were stronger, and the dark angel knew each of them, and each knew him. The dark angel bent over to pick up Azrael.

Azrael was one of the smallest of the hosts of heaven. Perhaps that is why Lucifer underestimated him, and why the dark angel was surprised at not being able to move him.

&ldquo;This is most strange. I have encountered few who were stronger than me, and none who could keep me from moving them. None until now that is. What strange creature are you?&rdquo;

Azrael did not speak; Azrael did not move.

And the dark angel left. And a few days later a demon lord appeared.

&ldquo;I am Craxus.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I am a demon lord, you had best come with me now.&rdquo;

Azrael stared east.

The demon lord pulled out his sword. His sword glowed golden, and the metal throbbed and moved, and from the blade came the sound of a thousand distant voices singing. The demon lord touched the blade to the center of Azrael&rsquo;s chest, cutting a thin line in the flesh. He moved the blade across the chest, cutting through Azrael&rsquo;s right nipple. Bright blue blood flowed slowly from the cut. Azrael never moved.

Craxus made two more cuts, and then carved another cut above Azrael&rsquo;s eyes. The blue blood trickled down into his eyes. Soon his eyes were covered with his blood.

Azrael moved: he blinked his eyes. He rubbed his eyes.

He turned to Craxus. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Your nemesis,&rdquo; answered Craxus. &ldquo;You have ignored Lucifer and resisted the dark angel. So now I have come.&rdquo;

Azrael said to Craxus, &ldquo;You should have left me as you found me. I was on the verge of discovering a great truth, but now that I have been interrupted I will have to start again from the beginning. And it takes so long, so very long.&rdquo;

Azrael paused, and then looked at Craxus and said, &ldquo;Who sent you to get me?&rdquo;

Craxus said, &ldquo;It was Lucifer who sent me.&rdquo;

Azrael looked upwards and said, &ldquo;He shall leave me unmolested in the future. You are merely an instrument, not the target of my anger. Lucifer, on the other hand, has meddled in things that should be left alone, and I am quite angry with him.&rdquo;

He paused, then continued, &ldquo;Consider your duty done, your obligation fulfilled. You are dismissed. You may return to Lucifer and tell him that he must let me be. It is best for all.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Your arrogance is insufferable! You give me, a demon lord, orders as if I was some lowly messenger-boy. And you talk of Lucifer meddling in things&mdash;do you not see that it is you who is the meddler, foolishly playing with powerful forces about which you have no comprehension?&rdquo; said Craxus.

Azrael said, &ldquo;Begone! And make haste, for your presence gives offense.&rdquo;

Craxus said, &ldquo;You are a fool. Some say that pain is a song, and that I am one of its greatest singers. I will sing a beautiful song for you, and the pain you will receive will only be outweighed by the pleasure I will derive from your suffering; you will suffer a long, long time.&rdquo;

Azrael walked over to him. Craxus picked up the sword and swung. Azrael made no move to avoid it. The sword hit him. There was a bright blue flash when the sword hit him, and Azrael fell to one knee. Craxus smiled. Craxus lifted his sword over his head, and brought it down one final time.

Azrael waited until the sword was about to pierce his chest when he grabbed the blade with both hands and snapped the sword. Suddenly the singing from the sword turned into screaming, and the bright golden glow started fading from the sword and pouring out onto the ground below. The throbbing turned into spasmodic jerking. The sword was dying.

And soon Craxus was dying as well, although he did not know that because it had been an eternity since death had walked the land. All had forgotten about death.

Craxus looked into Azrael&rsquo;s eyes, seeing something that he had never encountered in his eternal existence. Something very dark. &ldquo;What do I see in your eyes?&rdquo;

&ldquo;It is death,&rdquo; said Azrael, &ldquo;it is death that you see in my eyes.&rdquo;

And that is how Craxus, the demon lord, was undone. And that ended the age where there was no death, for death had been awakened from his slumber, and death now walked the land again.


Azrael looked around. He looked at where he had stood&mdash;he looked at the ground underneath where his feet had stood, ground which had not seen the light of day since almost the beginning. Time passed.

Azrael turned west, and began to walk slowly.


He walked up to the gates of Hell. One side was horn, and the other side was ivory. Above the gate read the inscription, &ldquo;Abandon hope all ye who enter.&rdquo; Azrael looked up at the inscription, and for the second time since his awakening, a smile crossed his face. It was a subtle smile, a hint of a smile.

Azrael did not resemble the hosts of heaven. He was short and squat. Nor did he resemble the hordes of Hell. He was pure white, for white is truly the color of death.

A giant was sitting on the gate. The giant looked at Azrael. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he bellowed.

&ldquo;I am who I am,&rdquo; said Azrael, for so much time had passed that he had forgotten his own name.

&ldquo;Why are you here?&rdquo; asked the giant.

&ldquo;I am here,&rdquo; answered Azrael.

The giant laughed and said, &ldquo;Well spoken, my friend. You have given me amusement, and it has been a long time since I have been amused. Allow me the pleasure of giving you a gift; it is a warning: you may find many surprises if you pass through this entrance.&rdquo;

Azrael smiled and answered, &ldquo;I think <i>you</i> may find many surprises if I pass through this entrance.&rdquo;

The giant laughed again. He said, &ldquo;Let us pass through these gates together, then, for surprises are a most precious commodity for an immortal.&rdquo;

Azrael laughed. It was a deep rumbling laugh, very surprising coming from such a small creature. The laugh reminded one of distant thunder. And there was an unsettling aspect to the laugh when one listened closely: underneath the rumbling, one could almost hear the screams of the dying. It was not a pleasant laugh.

But that did not seem to bother the giant. The giant smiled. And though he was smiling, his eyes were sad. They were they eyes of someone who had seen everything and yet was still searching.

Azrael said, &ldquo;And what is your name?&rdquo;

&ldquo;They call me Prometheus.&rdquo;

&ldquo;And why were you at the gates, Prometheus?&rdquo;

&ldquo;I was waiting,&rdquo; he answered cryptically.

They entered the gates together.


Azrael noticed that the inside of the gates were not different from the outside of the gates: lone and level sands stretching far off to the horizon.

&ldquo;Where do we go from here?&rdquo; asked Azrael.

&ldquo;It does not matter where one goes once one is inside the gates,&rdquo; answered Prometheus, &ldquo;that is one of the aspects of Hell. Notice that the gate is no longer behind us. That is another aspect of Hell: it is much easier finding the way in than finding the way out.&rdquo;

&ldquo;How did you get out?&rdquo; asked Azrael.

Prometheus did not answer, only saying, &ldquo;Let us continue to walk.&rdquo;


They walked. Soon a large elephant-like creature appeared on the horizon. Slowly they approached it. As they got nearer, Azrael realized that he had been tricked by the lack of reference points: the creature was not merely large but monstrously huge. And still the creature loomed larger. Azrael believed that the back of the creature must be touching the sky itself, and he wondered if the hairs on the top of the creature had been singed by the passage of the sun.

&ldquo;Hail Prometheus,&rdquo; boomed the creature. The creature&rsquo;s voice rumbled deep, and the ground shook when he spoke. If Azrael&rsquo;s laugh sounded like distant thunder, this creature&rsquo;s voice felt like a nearby earthquake.

&ldquo;Have you brought me a tender morsel, Prometheus?&rdquo; asked the creature.

&ldquo;I am sorry to disappoint you, Leviathan, but this one is traveling under my protection.&rdquo;

Azrael stood mute. He was small, and was used to creatures bigger than he, but he had never encountered one this big before.

&ldquo;Hail, oh protected one,&rdquo; said Leviathan to Azrael.

&ldquo;Hail,&rdquo; answered Azrael.

&ldquo;Where are you going, Prometheus?&rdquo; asked Leviathan.

&ldquo;We are going.&rdquo;

&ldquo;A word of caution: the Eagle roams freely in Hell looking for you.&rdquo;

Prometheus&rsquo;s lip curled: &ldquo;I know; thank you for the warning, my friend.&rdquo;

&ldquo;You are welcome. Take care.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Take care.&rdquo;

They walked on. Azrael turned around to look at Leviathan one more time, but could not see him even though they had only walked a few paces. &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; Azrael asked.

&ldquo;Leviathan has not moved. We have moved.&rdquo;

&ldquo;But I can no longer see him.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Yes, and you could no longer see the gate after we entered it. One descends into Hell much more quickly than one would expect from counting the paces. The laws are different here. There will be other surprises as well.&rdquo;

Azrael&rsquo;s forehead creased. He had not expected this.


In the distance, Azrael saw a stream. &ldquo;What is that river?&rdquo; asked Azrael.

&ldquo;It is the river Lethe. It is a dangerous river. We will need to cross it.&rdquo;

They arrived at the banks of the river Lethe. But it was not water which flowed through the river Lethe&mdash;it was as if the deepest blue sapphires had been turned to liquid and poured. And the river did not flow smoothly&mdash;it appeared that a thousand shapes were struggling under the water, struggling to break free.

&ldquo;We must run across the river quickly,&rdquo; said Prometheus, &ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo;

&ldquo;I am ready,&rdquo; answered Azrael.

Prometheus started running. He moved very quickly. Azrael ran behind him. Azrael was halfway across when the demon lord Craxus erupted from the flowing sapphire on which he was running.

&ldquo;Pray tell, where do you think you are going?&rdquo; asked Craxus, unsheathing his sword, &ldquo;I believe we have some unfinished business.&rdquo;

Craxus brought his sword down, cutting a diagonal stripe across Azrael&rsquo;s chest. The cut burned, and blue flames leapt around the edges of the wound. Azrael moved to grab Craxus&rsquo;s sword, but Craxus was too quick, and Azrael was left clutching empty air.

Craxus brought his sword down again. Azrael moved to grab it, but again Craxus was too fast, and another burning cut appeared on his chest. Azrael leapt forward. Craxus jumped to the side, cutting Azrael on his arm. Again Azrael leapt, and again Azrael missed; and again Craxus dodged, and again Craxus cut.

&ldquo;Are you surprised to see me, my friend?&rdquo; asked Craxus, laughing, &ldquo;Do you know that I am also called the Demon of a Thousand Cuts? Did you imagine that you could prevail against me?&rdquo;

The golden sword of Craxus throbbed and sung triumphantly. Craxus cut Azrael again, and again.

&ldquo;Small white one, this is only the very beginning. I will keep cutting you for the next few millennia. Your Hell has only begun.&rdquo;

Azrael stopped, stood still, and stared at Craxus.

Suddenly Craxus leapt behind Azrael, too fast for Azrael&rsquo;s eyes to follow. And then Craxus picked up Azrael from the back of the neck. Azrael&rsquo;s hand clamped down on Craxus&rsquo;s arm, and he spun around in Craxus&rsquo;s grasp. Now he was facing Craxus, holding Craxus&rsquo;s arm firmly.

&ldquo;Make your peace Craxus. Your end is near,&rdquo; said Azrael triumphantly.

Azrael reached out with his other hand to grab Craxus&rsquo;s neck. Azrael gently fingered Craxus&rsquo;s neck, almost like a lover, looking for the right grip. He found it. He started to squeeze slowly&mdash;there was no need to rush.


There was a flash of light. Azrael realized that it was not Craxus that was in his grip, but Prometheus. And he also realized that he was no longer on the river Lethe, but now he was on the far banks.

&ldquo;Is this a trick?&rdquo; asked Azrael, not relinquishing his grip.

&ldquo;No, this is no trick,&rdquo; answered Prometheus.

&ldquo;Then what happened to the demon lord Craxus?&rdquo; asked Azrael.

&ldquo;Was that your vision, then?&rdquo; asked Prometheus. &ldquo;Was that whom you were fighting?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Azrael. He looked at his body, and noticed that all the cuts that Craxus had given him had disappeared.

&ldquo;I have been deceived,&rdquo; said Azrael, relinquishing his grip on Prometheus.

&ldquo;Always remember: in Hell, deception is practiced on a grand scale,&rdquo; said Prometheus.

He continued, &ldquo;Many have attempted to cross the river Lethe. Most have become trapped by the visions therein. Soon those who are trapped become absorbed into the river itself, and the river grows a little wider.&rdquo;

Prometheus said, &ldquo;When I arrived here on this side I turned around and saw that you had stopped in the middle of the river. You were leaping back and forth, fighting something that only you could see. I knew that you risked becoming trapped. I ran back to get you.&rdquo;

Azrael asked, &ldquo;How is it that you were able to lift me?&rdquo;

Prometheus answered, &ldquo;My father is Japet, the Titan; my brother is Atlas.&rdquo;

Azrael asked, &ldquo;Why did you not tell me that there were illusions in the river Lethe?&rdquo;

Prometheus answered, &ldquo;I am forbidden from revealing the illusions. Everyone must discover the illusions themselves.&rdquo;

Azrael said, &ldquo;You risked much when you rescued me. I could have destroyed you unwittingly. Would not it have been safer to reveal the illusions to me and bear the penalties than to run the risk of being destroyed?&rdquo;

Prometheus looked at Azrael, and again Azrael noticed the sadness of someone who knows too much, of someone who sees the past and foretells the future. &ldquo;A long time ago, I was forbidden from providing mortals with certain things. I disobeyed. I was punished, severely, and to this day I am still serving my sentence. I will never blindly obey, but I will always choose carefully when to disobey.&rdquo;


They heard a crying in the distance. A black spot appeared in the sky. Prometheus sighed.

&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Azrael.

Prometheus did not answer. Suddenly the ground lifted beneath them, throwing Azrael off to the side. The ground shaped itself into a large rock, Prometheus on the top. The rock shook; Prometheus fell. Now Prometheus lay on top of the rock. Manacles sprang from the rock, binding his hands and his feet.

&ldquo;Prometheus, what is happening?&rdquo; asked Azrael.

Prometheus answered, &ldquo;I am paying the price for providing mortals with fire.&rdquo;

Azrael noticed that the crying had gotten much louder. He turned around and saw the eagle flying directly towards them. The eagle was directly above them when he dove down, landing on the bound Prometheus. The eagle started to peck at Prometheus&rsquo;s flesh.

&ldquo;Let me help you, Prometheus.&rdquo;

&ldquo;There is nothing you can do.&rdquo;

Azrael started to climb the rock, but he could not find purchase: every time he grasped the rock it would flow underneath and re-shape itself. He finally punched the rock, punched it so hard with his fist that blue blood sprang from his knuckles, but the rock was still there.

He looked up. The eagle had torn open Prometheus&rsquo;s chest and was struggling to get something out. Finally it succeeded. The eagle had in his beak something dark and bloody, which he flung around twice before gobbling down. The eagle gave a final cry of success then flew off.

The rock melted slowly, merging back into the flat gray sands from which it came. Prometheus was slowly lowered to the ground. The chains were the last to go; they turned into sand and the wind blew them away. Prometheus&rsquo;s torso was ripped open and there was blood everywhere. Prometheus moaned softly.

Prometheus rested. Finally he turned to Azrael and said, &ldquo;I am sorry that you witnessed that.&rdquo;

Prometheus continued, &ldquo;I provided mortals with fire. It was forbidden. I was punished. I was chained to a rock and every day an eagle came and ate my liver, and every night my liver grew back. Finally, a certain mortal set me free, and the eagle plagued me no more.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Then why does the eagle plague you now?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Because we are in Hell.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Did the eagle plague you when you were outside the gates?&rdquo;

&ldquo;No.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Then why did you enter the gates?&rdquo;

Prometheus looked at Azrael with eyes full of sorrow, full of understanding. He answered, &ldquo;I entered the gates to show you the way through Hell. Without a guide, one can become easily lost. Hell is very large, and there are many traps to entangle and keep you here. You were unlike any I had seen before, and I did not want to see you lost in the labyrinths. That is why I entered the gates.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Did you know that the eagle would find you?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;

Azrael looked into Prometheus&rsquo;s eyes.

Azrael felt an anger welling up inside him. A large anger, a huge anger. He said, &ldquo;Allow me to repay you for helping me in this strange land. I will stop the eagle. Let me know what it is that I need to do. It has been a long time since I have used my powers, but I do not think that they have faded with age.&rdquo;

Prometheus looked at him sadly and said, &ldquo;My friend, my punishment is woven deep into the fabric of Hell itself. To defeat the eagle, one would have to unravel that fabric, overturn Hell. As much as I would enjoy to see that happen, I know that it is impossible.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Nothing is impossible.&rdquo;

Prometheus laughed, &ldquo;My little white friend, we are but two against the dark powers. Though I agree that nothing is impossible, I would argue that few things are less probable then overturning this forsaken place.&rdquo;

Azrael smiled. &ldquo;Do you have the will, the will to try? Though we are but two, I feel we can accomplish great things.&rdquo;

Prometheus&rsquo;s eyes glimmered, and he said, &ldquo;I am willing to try.&rdquo;

Azrael said, &ldquo;We will need help.&rdquo;

Prometheus said, &ldquo;There are many enemies of Hell. But before they fall in with us, they will need to be given a taste of victory. They will not blindly follow us.&rdquo;

Azrael said, &ldquo;I suspect that soon enough we will have a taste of victory. Let us continue westward.&rdquo;

Azrael and Prometheus walked westward towards the setting sun. Prometheus wondered at this small white creature&rsquo;s willingness to risk all in a gambit against Hell itself. And yet somehow this small white one was oddly compelling. There was the air of the unstoppable about him; it was as if this white creature was the manifestation of an irresistible force.

And there also was the touch of the innocent to him, this na&iuml;f in Hell. Prometheus felt compelled to warn him again, &ldquo;Always remember: in Hell, deception is practiced on a grand scale,&rdquo;

Azrael simply smiled.


Lucifer looked over his domain. He had not heard from Craxus, who should have already returned from his quest to destroy the small white creature. He picked up a handful of sand in his fingers and spat in it. He started working the sand, shaping it into a small bird. He crafted a small bird with large wings. He turned his work over in his hands. He was pleased. He plucked a single hair from his eyebrow and worked it into the bird of sand. Finally he breathed into the mouth of the bird, and the bird&rsquo;s eyes started to flutter, and the bird&rsquo;s wings started to beat. Lucifer smiled at his work.

And he said, &ldquo;Obey my commands, winged one: you must find the demon lord Craxus; you must tell him to return to me; and you yourself must return to me and tell me where you found him.&rdquo;

Lucifer opened his hands, and the bird flew up. The bird flew straight up, and then started flying in circles, each circle much larger than the one before it. The bird flew fast, for it breathed devil&rsquo;s breath, and was fashioned with devil&rsquo;s spittle. The bird was soon out of sight.

Lucifer picked up another handful of sand. Again he spat in it, and again he fashioned it into the shape of an animal, but this time he made a fish. Again he plucked a single hair from his eyebrow, and again he worked it into the body of the creature of sand. And again he breathed life into the creature.

And he said, &ldquo;Obey my commands, gilled one: you must find the demon lord Craxus; you must tell him to return to me; and you yourself must return to me and tell me where you found him.&rdquo;

And then Lucifer threw the fish, and the fish tumbled through the sky, until it landed in an ocean. And then the fish started swimming through the ocean looking for Craxus.

And then Lucifer created the fire salamander, and commanded the fire salamander to look for Craxus, and threw the fire salamander into one of the fiery pits in the inferno.

And finally Lucifer created the earthworm, and commanded the earthworm to search for Craxus, and then dropped the earthworm in the gray sand, where the earthworm burrowed down.

And then Lucifer filled his bowl with water and lit his brazier, and waited patiently, for patience is a necessary virtue for an immortal.


The bird returned first. &ldquo;My lord, I have flown through the nine rings of Hell, and to the four corners of earth, and I have found no sign of Craxus.&rdquo;

Lucifer nodded, and then plucked the single hair jutting from the top of the head of the bird, and the bird dissolved into sand.

The fish returned next, splashing in the bowl of water that Lucifer had filled. &ldquo;My lord, I have swum through all the oceans and seas, through all the rivers and streams, through all the lakes and ponds, and I have found no sign of Craxus.&rdquo;

Lucifer nodded, and then plucked the single hair jutting from the mouth of the fish, and the fish dissolved into sand.

The fire salamander returned next. &ldquo;My lord, I have been through all the fires in Hell, and all the fires on earth. I have been through the volcanoes of belching flame and through the rivers of burning lava. I have even been to the raging fires of the sun and the flames that burn in the forges of the Cyclops, and yet I have seen no sign of Craxus.&rdquo;

And Lucifer plucked the hair from the salamander, and the salamander dissolved into sand, extinguishing the fire.

The earthworm returned last, appearing at his feet. &ldquo;My lord, I have burrowed through all the valleys and mountains of earth, I have burrowed through the mines and shafts, through the cold ground in the Arctic and the steamy earth of the jungle. I have burrowed to the center of the earth and back again. And I have seen no sign of Craxus. But I did find the blood of his sword.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Continue, earthworm,&rdquo; said Lucifer.

&ldquo;The sword bled golden blood on the grounds to the east of the entrance to Hell. I could feel the indentations of Craxus&rsquo;s footprints up to that point, but there were no footprints after that. No footprints of Craxus, that is; there were footprints, but of a much smaller creature, departing from there. It was as if Craxus had broken his sword and then transformed himself into a smaller creature.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Did you follow those footprints, earthworm?&rdquo; asked Lucifer.

&ldquo;I did, my lord. The footprints went to the gates of Hell, where they were joined by a much larger set of footprints. The sets of prints skirted Leviathan, and I followed them to the banks of the river Lethe, but I lost them after that.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Did you find anything else?&rdquo; asked Lucifer.

&ldquo;No, my lord,&rdquo; said the earthworm.

&ldquo;You have done well. You may ask your boon,&rdquo; said Lucifer.

&ldquo;Thank you, my lord. I have a small boon: I would like to be free to burrow in the soils of earth; I found it very pleasant there,&rdquo; said the earthworm.

&ldquo;Your wish will be granted,&rdquo; said Lucifer, stroking the earthworm, &ldquo;you shall burrow in the rich soils of earth, and you shall find a mate and be fruitful. Furthermore, I will make you immortal.&rdquo;

Suddenly Lucifer plucked the hair from the back of the earthworm, and the earthworm dissolved into sand, his false promises dissolving as well. Lucifer laughed, and his evil laughter rang across the sands.


Lucifer walked north. For three days and three nights he walked north, until a single crack appeared in the otherwise uniform gray sand. Fumes rose out of the crack. He followed the crack, which zigzagged through the sands. Suddenly he came upon three hooded creatures. They stood around the crack, which split off into three directions. A three-legged stool was placed over the spot where the three cracks met. A thick, strangely sweet green smoke gently rose out from underneath the stool. He looked at the three creatures.

&ldquo;Hail Lucifer, and welcome,&rdquo; the three spoke in unison, &ldquo;we have been awaiting your arrival.&rdquo;

The three spoke in strange voices. Even though the voices were clear, it seemed as if they were talking from far, far away. And also there were strange timbres to the voices, as if they were formed by an alien throat trying to capture the language of the immortals. And there was a quality to their speaking which made one think that they were reading from a script which was written at the dawn of time, and they were simply waiting for a cue from the other actors. One of the creatures sat down on the stool. Again the three spoke together, &ldquo;Ask your questions, Lucifer.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Need I bother to ask the questions? You already know what it is I seek.&rdquo;

&ldquo;There are no answers without questions.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Lucifer, &ldquo;Who slew Craxus?&rdquo;

The three stood mute. The one on the stool slowly but deeply breathed the fumes emanating from the cracks underneath. Time passed.

Again all three spoke, &ldquo;Azrael, the angel of death, slew Craxus and destroyed his sword.&rdquo;

Lucifer frowned when he heard the name of the angel that, when time was young, was one of the most feared of angels, at times even more feared than Lucifer himself. He muttered to himself, &ldquo;So, Azrael, you were not dead after all. What have you been doing all this time? You were always the strange one.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Lucifer, addressing the three again, &ldquo;And how can I destroy him?&rdquo;

The three stood silently. Then they spoke, &ldquo;There were three swords that could slay the angel of death; their names were Moonlight, Starlight, and Sunlight. Moonlight was the sword of Michael the archangel; and you, Lucifer, destroyed that sword when you stormed the gates of heaven. Sunlight was the sword that Craxus the demon lord wielded, and Azrael destroyed Sunlight when Craxus was so foolish to awake him. Now only the third sword, Starlight, remains. The three Cyclops keep that sword in their forge.&rdquo;

Lucifer asked, &ldquo;Can Azrael destroy me?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Azrael can oppose you, but he cannot destroy you. There is only one creature capable of destroying you, Lord Lucifer, and that is yourself. The combined power of Earth and Hell cannot bring you down.&rdquo;

Lucifer laughed again. &ldquo;Then I shall not fear.&rdquo;

Lucifer asked, &ldquo;And where is Azrael now?&rdquo;

The three spoke, &ldquo;You have asked your three questions, and you have been given three answers. There will be no more. Fare thee well, Lucifer.&rdquo;

Lucifer answered, &ldquo;Fare thee well.&rdquo; And Lucifer left the Fates standing above the crack.



Lucifer walked a day and a night until he arrived at the lair of the Cyclops. The air was very hot. He walked into the forge where the three Cyclops worked, three of the oldest creatures in existence.

The air burned and smelled of sulfur. The sounds of the forge were very loud: the crackling of the fires, the clanging of the hammer, the pumping of the bellows, and the hissing of water. And overlaying the noise of the forge were the sounds of the thunderstorm. He heard the crackle of lightning, the rumbling of thunder, and the boom of the thunderbolt. And the sounds of the thunderstorm came from the mouths of the three Cyclops, for they were creatures of the storm, and they spoke the language of the storm, and their names were Lightning, Thunder, and Thunderbolt.

&ldquo;I have come for a boon,&rdquo; said Lucifer.

The sounds of the storm stopped. The clanging of the hammer stopped. The three Cyclops stared at Lucifer, three eyes staring unblinking at the baron of Hell. One of the Cyclops spoke and asked, &ldquo;What?&rdquo;

&ldquo;I need the sword that is called Starlight.&rdquo;

The sound was deafening: lightning crackled, thunder rolled, and on top of it all was the loud booming of the thunderbolt. The request was not one to be taken lightly, and they were vigorously discussing it amongst themselves. Finally the sounds of the storm receded, and the first Cyclops turned to Lucifer and said simply, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I am willing to bargain,&rdquo; he said, a charming smile spreading across his face.  &ldquo;And I am known for keeping my word. Would you like a mountain of gold? Or a diamond as big as a house? I imagine that fine smiths as yourselves would find these things useful; these things are within my power to provide.&rdquo;

Again the sounds of the thunderstorm crashed through the forge, and again they receded, and again the first Cyclops turned to Lucifer and said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;

Lucifer&rsquo;s smile grew wider and he said, &ldquo;Remember, you can ask for anything in my power. This opportunity will not come again.&rdquo;

Lightning crackled, and the tempo was picked up by Thunder, and Thunderbolt then spoke. Finally the first Cyclops turned to Lucifer, pointed at Lucifer&rsquo;s chest, and said, &ldquo;Heart.&rdquo;

&ldquo;For my heart?&rdquo; asked Lucifer.

The Cyclops nodded.

Lucifer pondered. He lifted his hand to his chest. He lifted one fingernail, pressed it against the flesh just below his throat, and drew it quickly downward, until he reached his navel. Blood started flowing from the wound. He reached into his chest and pulled out his heart. He held it out to the Cyclops.

The heart was emerald-green, with black veins running through it. It glowed slightly, and although it was beautiful to behold, it evoked disturbing thoughts. A discordant throbbing noise emanated from it. It was surrounded by a halo that glowed darkly, and the black veins of the heart arranged themselves into letters that belonged to an alphabet that should never have been created, spelling secrets that should be left unknown. The Cyclops gasped. The first Cyclops picked up the heart from Lucifer&rsquo;s outstretched hand. He examined it intently. His brothers could not help themselves, and they crowded around the first brother to examine their new possession.

For the first time in the forge, there was silence.

Lucifer waited.

The first Cyclops finally looked up, saw Lucifer, handed the heart to his brother and walked to the back of the forge. He reached into one of the brightest fires and pulled out a sword. Like Craxus&rsquo;s sword, this sword throbbed and pulsed, and one could hear distant voices singing as the sword was wielded. Unlike Craxus&rsquo;s blade, this one glowed silver, not golden. The Cyclops passed the sword to Lucifer, handle first.

Lucifer thanked the Cyclops and left. Lucifer smiled to himself as he thought of the terrible punishments that he would inflict on the prodigal Angel of Death. He unfurled his wings, and flew up to the sky, like a hawk seeking prey.


&ldquo;We will need weapons, Azrael,&rdquo; said Prometheus.

&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Azrael.

&ldquo;There are but two of us against Lucifer, and he is a terrible foe. We will need weapons.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Where shall we get these weapons, Prometheus?&rdquo;

&ldquo;We shall steal them from the Cyclops.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I find thievery distasteful.&rdquo;

&ldquo;We have little choice. We need weapons.&rdquo; Prometheus said, with his sad eyes, eyes of a good creature forced to do evil things, &ldquo;Hell bends us to its ways, and the path is dark before us.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Let it be done. But I will not help.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Prometheus, &ldquo;stay here. I will do it. I will be back soon.&rdquo;


Prometheus left. Azrael waited. Prometheus returned. He smiled at Azrael, &ldquo;the Cyclops move quickly, but I move more quickly. I was successful.&rdquo;

He opened his bag, and out fell a pair of winged sandals, a brown cloth cloak, and an emerald breastplate with black highlights. He continued, &ldquo;The sandals will give you flight, and the cloak will make you invisible, and the breastplate will protect you. Once there was a sword of great power in the forge, but I could not find it; I left in haste.&rdquo;


Lucifer flew, looking at the ground for traces of Azrael. He spied the footprints. He was surprised to find them leading back in the direction whence he had come. He flew, fast and low to the ground, back to the Cyclops&rsquo;s lair.  Flames leapt from his wings and face. Soon he saw the giant Prometheus.

&ldquo;Prometheus, where is your little friend?&rdquo; asked Lucifer, his voice booming like an oncoming hurricane, &ldquo;Tell him that I have come for him, and I will amuse myself with you in the meanwhile.&rdquo;

Lucifer flew directly into Prometheus, knocking the giant onto the ground.

&ldquo;Your previous punishments shall seem like nectar of the gods when I work my will upon you, Prometheus,&rdquo; said Lucifer, straddling the fallen giant, &ldquo;You have again disobeyed, and again betrayed, and I will take personal delight in meting out your punishment.&rdquo;

Suddenly Lucifer felt two small hands close on his throat. He felt death. Death was behind him. Lucifer bucked and spun around, but the grip was strong, and it held.

&ldquo;Do you remember me, brother?&rdquo; a voice whispered in Lucifer&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;Do you remember death? Do you remember the beginning? Do you remember the first struggle, the first time you rebelled? Do you remember who it was who held you fast so that brother Michael was able to throw you into the abyss? It was I. And I shall not let you go this time.&rdquo;

Lucifer finally turned, though he was not able to break the grip. He coughed, for he could barely breathe. Although he felt Azrael&rsquo;s hands around his throat, and although he knew that Azrael stood in front of him, he could not see Azrael, only the empty air. Then he spoke and said, &ldquo;You have chosen to hide. How dare you hide from the Prince of Darkness, the Angel of Light.&rdquo; And Lucifer became brighter and brighter, until he was impossible to behold, for he was so bright. And still he grew brighter. And the brightness shone through all, and as the brilliance of the sun makes the stars disappear, so did the brilliance of Lucifer make the sun disappear.

&ldquo;Now we are equal, for neither can see the other,&rdquo; said Lucifer.

And Lucifer reached out to the Angel of Death, and reached towards his throat. With his other hand, he unsheathed the sword, Starlight.

&ldquo;You should have left me alone, brother Lucifer. You were a fool to wake me, and now I shall destroy you.&rdquo;

Lucifer pressed the point of the sword against the body of Azrael. He felt resistance. He pushed harder. Still, the sword did not penetrate. Summoning all his strength, the Lord of Hell pushed for the third time. Lucifer wondered what it was that was protecting the Angel of Death&mdash;never had he encountered something which tested his mettle so. The sword suddenly broke past the resistance, into the Angel of Death.

&ldquo;Azrael, I have destroyed you. You could never have destroyed me&mdash;the Fates told me that none can stand against me. You were a fool to come into my dominion, to challenge the most beautiful of angels.&rdquo;

And then Lucifer realized he, the lord of Hell, was dying.


&ldquo;How can this be?&rdquo; Lucifer asked.  &ldquo;How can I be dying?&rdquo;

Prometheus laughed. He said, &ldquo;The breastplate that was protecting Azrael was fashioned from your heart. To destroy the Angel of Death you first had to destroy yourself. And this did not occur by chance; believe me, Lord Lucifer, it took me eons to orchestrate your downfall.&rdquo;

Prometheus continued talking as the brilliance slowly faded from Lucifer, &ldquo;Most difficult, of course, was finding a being that you actually feared, feared enough to trade your heart for a sword that would slay him. For a long time I despaired of finding such a being, for who would be both powerful enough to oppose you and foolish enough to challenge you? I could find no one.&rdquo;

&ldquo;The oldest of legends spoke of an angel of death, a fearsome angel, but I did not believe those legends, not at first. But I was desperate. Though the universe is large, I had an eternity to look. I searched low and high. Finally I discovered the statue, and that was the final piece. I merely had to wait until you, Lord Lucifer, discovered the statue. I trusted in your arrogance: I knew that once you had discovered the statue, you would alienate the Angel of Death with you high-handed actions. I was quite pleased when you unwittingly sent the demon lord Craxus to his doom; it focused Azrael&rsquo;s anger onto you, and it confirmed that Azrael was a force to be reckoned with.&rdquo;

Prometheus continued, &ldquo;Did you not know that the Cyclops were my uncles? It was I who gave them the sword Starlight in the beginning. I told them that a time would come when you would seek the sword, and that they should only give it to you in exchange for your heart, and that they should fashion a breastplate from that heart.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I have been deceived and betrayed,&rdquo; said Lucifer. And then Lucifer died.


The life leaked slowly out of Azrael. He lay on the sands, listening to Lucifer and Prometheus speak. His cloak had fallen off, and he was visible again. There was a large hole in the emerald breastplate, and through it poured blue blood pulsing. He knew he was dying.

Prometheus looked at Azrael with sadness in his eyes. He was weeping. He spoke:

&ldquo;I am very sorry, my friend. You have been ill-used, and I am the cause. Believe me, as I came to know you, I found it more and more difficult to proceed with my plan.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Before you leave us,&rdquo; continued Prometheus, &ldquo;could you tell me what great truth you were trying to find when you stared east for an eternity?&rdquo;

Azrael tried to speak, but his voice was weak, and he coughed blue blood. He tried again. It was a barely audible whisper. Prometheus bent down and put his head next to Azrael&rsquo;s mouth to listen. Azrael croaked again. Prometheus bent closer still.

Suddenly Azrael locked his hands around Prometheus&rsquo;s throat and began to throttle him. And Azrael spoke, clearly and loudly:

&ldquo;You have betrayed me. You came to me under the guise of friendship, and you destroyed me to serve your own ends. You pride yourself on being good; I say that you are no better than the corpse that lies yonder. My last wish, before I die, is to see you destroyed.&rdquo;

Azrael continued, &ldquo;Do you know what I sought to discover that eternity that I spent staring eastward? I had sought to understand death. I must content myself though with simply being an agent of death.&rdquo;

Thus Prometheus was undone.


And soon after, Azrael finally understood that which he had sought to understand.
