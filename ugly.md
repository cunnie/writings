## Ugly

She was one of those talented but homely women who raged at the injustice&mdash;she was great, so why did she have such a hard time getting the men she wanted?

Any guy could have told her the reason, but that type of brutal honesty is rare past junior high school.  Sure, that honesty is common when two men are talking between themselves about the girl, but rare when talking with the girl.

Eric, the tall dark-haired guitar player who attended the Berklee school with her, once said to his friend, &ldquo;Paula.  She&rsquo;s an awesome musician ya know?  She&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;

Eric was always restrained, but his friend was the opposite which was one of the threads that wove their friendship together, &ldquo;Yeah, and she digs you too, dude.  She&rsquo;s always coming up after class and talking with you and shit.  And you&rsquo;re a good guitar player but not the best in the class but she talks to you anyway because she&rsquo;s got a thing for you.&rdquo;

Eric was a little uncomfortable because he didn&rsquo;t want to acknowledge that Paula may have wanted more from him than just discussions about music, &ldquo;Aw, she&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;

&ldquo;What are you saying dude&mdash;you wanna go out with her?  I&rsquo;ll call her up now and tell her&mdash;she&rsquo;ll be psyched!   I&rsquo;ll tell her, &rsquo;yo, Eric wants to date you, but he plays hard to get, so you gotta dog him all the time.&rsquo; &rdquo;

Eric smiled in spite of himself, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that man; she&rsquo;s not my type.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Listen Eric, just because she&rsquo;s a little ugly doesn&rsquo;t mean it can&rsquo;t work; shit everybody looks the same with the lights out.  Besides with her crooked teeth suckin&rsquo; on your dick it&rsquo;d be extra stimulating, you know what I mean?&rdquo;

He had Eric laughing now, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t <i>you</i> go out with her then?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t I go out with her?  Because she was beaten with the Ugly Stick, that&rsquo;s why.  No wait: she wasn&rsquo;t just beaten with the Ugly Stick; she was climbing the Ugly Tree and then she fell and hit every branch on the way down!&rdquo;

Eric tried not to laugh but couldn&rsquo;t help himself.  &ldquo;Dude you can&rsquo;t say shit like that about someone.&rdquo;

&ldquo;What do you mean I can&rsquo;t say shit like she&rsquo;s ugly as sin?  It&rsquo;s the truth.  She&rsquo;s a bitchin&rsquo; musician, and that&rsquo;s the truth, too.  But she&rsquo;s also dog-ugly dude.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Well if she lost a little weight....&rdquo;

&ldquo;Dude you&rsquo;ve been hitting the crack-pipe again.  She&rsquo;d still be dog-ugly if she lost the weight, maybe even worse.  She&rsquo;s not built to be thin.  She&rsquo;s got the bones of a fat person.  She&rsquo;s got that blocky torso that&rsquo;s not going to change when she loses weight: broad shoulders, barrel-chest.  Her stomach might shrink a little but so will her tits, so it&rsquo;ll be a wash.  Besides that won&rsquo;t fix her ugly-assed face.&rdquo;

A dark look crossed Eric&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;Okay dude, that&rsquo;s enough.&rdquo;


Later in the year Eric and Paula did sleep together when they got drunk after one of the student concerts.  The next night Paula came down to his dorm room and banged on his door but Eric wouldn&rsquo;t come out, and Paula stayed there for five minutes banging on the door saying, &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re in there Eric,&rdquo; but Eric wouldn&rsquo;t come out. And then she started crying and ran back up to her room.
