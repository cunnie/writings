## The Wizard and the Ice Queen

### The Ice Queen

*&ldquo;What is the world, O soldiers?<br> It is I:<br> I this incessant snow,<br> This northern sky;<br> Soldiers, this solitude<br> Through which we go<br> is I.&rdquo;<br> <br> &mdash;Walter de La Mare, Napoleon*

The Ice Queen looked over the parapet and said, &ldquo;So you made an enemy of the wizard, and now you have come to me for help.  You are foolish, you know: my heart is frozen, and I have no pity for you.&rdquo;

The young man spoke to the queen, &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t seem so dangerous.&rdquo;

&ldquo;He is not just any wizard,&rdquo; said the Ice Queen, &ldquo;He is one of, if not the most, powerful of wizards.&rdquo;

The young man said, &ldquo;Well, if he is so powerful, then why have my spells protected me so far?&rdquo;

The Ice Queen turned from the parapet and stared into the young man&rsquo;s eyes.  The young man stared into the eyes of the Ice Queen. The young man saw ice in those eyes, ice which stretched far, far back, as far back as the dawn of time, and perhaps even farther than that.  Eyes that drilled into you, slowly, inexorably, like a glacier cutting through a mountain.

&ldquo;Great wizardry takes a long time to build up.  It is difficult to wield.  Simple magics work quickly, but they lack focus, are scatterbrained, and have, in a magical sense, little if any purpose. Your simple magics will protect you for a time, but your demolition is inevitable.  It may take weeks, months, or even years, but you will find that you will not be able to escape your fate.&rdquo;

The man looked into the Queen&rsquo;s eyes as the Queen spoke, and the man felt a tendril of coldness  touch his heart.  He shivered.

&ldquo;You should not remain in my domain,&rdquo; said the Queen.  &ldquo;It is unhealthy for humans to stay too long.&rdquo;

&ldquo;It is very cold here.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Yes, it is cold here, but that is the lesser danger.  There is also a spiritual cold here as well.  You have probably felt a hint of it already.  That is the greater danger.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t my magics continue to protect me?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Are you asking if your magics will protect you from the cold?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Yes, but also why they cannot protect me from him?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Ah.  A two-pronged question, like the horns of a bull.  Allow me to address your first question: this domain is very pervasive--it is hard to put up a magical shield to protect oneself from the effects. There are other ways, of course, to make this place more hospitable. One way is to simply not be here, but rather have some proxy or avatar instead.  Of course, the avatar will be subject to the full effects, and will probably die.  Another way is to slow the passage of time.  There is a statue in the hallway downstairs of a wizard who realized he had stayed too long.  Knowing that he did not have time to leave, he merely made time stop.  For himself.  He will &rsquo;wake up&rsquo; when he is no longer here--he was good enough to work that into his spell.  I have occasionally thought of bringing him to the border of my domain, but for obvious reasons I cannot do that.&rdquo;

&ldquo;You cannot leave here?&rdquo;

&ldquo;No.&rdquo;

&ldquo;What is stopping you from just walking out the front gate?&rdquo;

The Ice Queen smiled again, &ldquo;I cannot leave this place any more than you could leave your skin.&rdquo;

&ldquo;But my skin is part of me.&rdquo;

&ldquo;And this place is me.  This castle in which you stand, the snow through which you walked, this cold remote sky under which you slept--it is me.&rdquo;

&ldquo;So if I killed you, you would not die.&rdquo;

&ldquo;This conversation has taken an interesting turn.  If you were to destroy this part of me--this body of ice you see before you--then certain events would happen which are hard to describe.  I would feel pain, and I would be wounded, but by no means would I die.  It would be very, very difficult to destroy me.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Very difficult?&rdquo;

&ldquo;It is hard for me to conceive an event that would cause my destruction.  Great, great magic, perhaps.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Why will you not help me even though the wizard is your enemy?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Enemy?  The wizard is my enemy?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Yes, for you thwarted him when he was young, and you pushed him back to the southern reaches.&rdquo;

The Ice Queen smiled, &ldquo;He is not my enemy any more than the mountain is the enemy of the glacier.  When great things rub against each other, there is, of course, friction; but that does not mean there is hostility between us.  It is only natural that we should cross paths at cross purposes.  And I am sure it will happen again.  But I feel no rancor towards him, and I doubt that he feels rancor towards me.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I know that he has sworn to destroy you.&rdquo;

&ldquo;That was a century ago that he made that vow.  I do not believe that he still feels that way.&rdquo;

&ldquo;You did not answer my second question: why will not my magics continue to protect me?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Ah, yes--the bull&rsquo;s second horn--why your magics will not protect you.  Your magics will protect you neither from him nor from this place.  They might help a little bit, in the short term, but you will be crushed in the long term.  There are weaknesses in simple magics.  Holes.  Your magic is full of holes, and his magics will cut through them.&rdquo;

&ldquo;How much time do I have?&rdquo;

&ldquo;A year, maybe two.&rdquo; the Ice Queen replied.

&ldquo;You will not help me?&rdquo; asked the young man.

&ldquo;I cannot help you.  You are better off asking the mountains to help you.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Mountains aren&rsquo;t conscious; they can&rsquo;t help me.&rdquo;

The Ice Queen looked out over the parapet again, &ldquo;You misunderstand me,&rdquo; the Ice Queen said.  &ldquo;I cannot help you.  It is not something in which I have a choice.&rdquo;

The queen continued, &ldquo;You must leave now; your magical defenses are buckling, and this land--I--will destroy you.  You have little time.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I am cold,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;Perhaps I could light a fire to warm myself before I go?&rdquo;

The Ice Queen suppressed a smile, &ldquo;I do not think you will be able to light a fire here.&rdquo;

The young man said, &ldquo;I have a little spell; it usually works, even in very cold places.&rdquo;

The young man took out a small black stick and sprinkled dust on it. He started muttering in low voice.  His voice strained in an alien tongue.   A small flame appeared at the end of the stick.

&ldquo;Your demeanor belies your accomplishment; you are a magician of no mean skill.  I can think of only a handful of wizards who could light a flame here.  Only the best,&rdquo; spoke the Ice Queen.  &ldquo;I think you have tried to deceive me.  I will now extinguish the flame.&rdquo;

The room grew visibly darker and colder, and a northwind blew into the room.  The flame flickered, and seemed to almost go out, when suddenly it grew brighter.

The Ice Queen clutched her belly, cried out in pain, and fell to her knees.

&ldquo;It hurts, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; asked the young man.

The Ice Queen remained silent, then slowly rose to her feet.  She then walked slowly over to the young man, touched the young man&rsquo;s cheek, looked into the young man&rsquo;s eyes, and said, &ldquo;You are the wizard&rsquo;s avatar, and you have come to destroy me.&rdquo;

The young man nodded, &ldquo;It has taken a hundred years to craft my revenge.  The wizard that is frozen in your hallway was one of my most able students.  When he did not return from the mission, I realized that I would have to come myself.  I pretended to beseech your help because I needed to get close to you.  I determined that an avatar was probably the safest way, which you subsequently confirmed.&rdquo;

The flame had continued to grow brighter, and the room started to become almost warm.  There was a deafening boom, and large cracks appeared in the walls.  The castle of ice was beginning to fall apart.

And the first sign of water appeared in the castle of ice: a single tear fell from the face of the Ice Queen.

And, in the castle of ice, the Ice Queen wept while the young man laughed.


### The Wizard

*&ldquo;He is plotting to become a Power.  He has a mind of<br /> metal and wheels; and he does not care for growing<br /> things, except as far as they serve him for the moment.&rdquo;<br /> <br> &mdash;J. R. R. Tolkien, The Two Towers*


Far away, in the wizard&rsquo;s tower, the wizard shook his head as if awakening from a slumber.  Surrounding him were five of his students.  They too were wakening from their trance.

&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; the youngest student asked, &ldquo;why were we cut off so suddenly?&rdquo;

An older student looked at him and sneered, &ldquo;because the avatar died.&rdquo;

The wizard said, &ldquo;Perhaps the castle crumbled, or perhaps the Ice Queen indulged in a petulant slaying.  The flame, though, will still be burning.  Of that we can be sure.  Let us go then, you and I, to the Chamber of Mirrors.&rdquo;

They tramped up the circular stairs to the Chamber of Mirrors.  The name, in a sense, was a misnomer, for there were no mirrors in the Chamber--there was only a small pool of water in the middle of the room.  The wizard and his students formed a ring around the pool and sat down.  The wizard thew some herbs over the water, passing his hands over the surface, muttering words under his breath.  The pool suddenly clouded over.

&ldquo;Odd,&rdquo; said the wizard.

&ldquo;Odd?&rdquo; asked the youngest student.

&ldquo;Yes, this is odd,&rdquo; said the wizard.  &ldquo;My spell seems to be working; however, the clouding of the water would indicate that there may be other magic working as well.  But it might be some trace magic from an earlier spell, or perhaps a little magic left in the wake of the powerful sorcery we conducted earlier.  Interesting.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Fog?&rdquo; asked the youngest student.

&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; asked the wizard.

&ldquo;Maybe your spell is working fine.  Maybe the water is cloudy because the place we are looking at is cloudy.  Maybe it&rsquo;s fog.&rdquo;

The wizard looked at the clouded water, and slowly nodded his head, &ldquo;You may be right; we may need to visit in person.&rdquo;

The wizard started absentmindedly fumbling in his pockets for the right materials while his mouth was already starting to form the words necessary to travel to the Ice Queen&rsquo;s domain.  The air became heavy, full of half-seen shapes.  A quiet groaning could be heard in the room.

The room changed into a ship, though it was hard to pinpoint the exact moment of transition--it seemed that the room became more and more shiplike, and less and less roomlike.  The wizard continued muttering.

A wizard&rsquo;s ship does not sail on water but instead sails on air--a convenience much appreciated by magicians.  A smile actually cut across the Wizard&rsquo;s face--he was going to witness firsthand the destruction--the remains of the destruction--of his enemy the Ice Queen.  The destruction of his sworn enemy had two purposes.  The first, more obvious one, was the downfall of his enemy.  The second purpose was to cement his reputation as one of the greatest, if not the greatest, wizards of all time.  A smile played upon his lips.

The ride went smoothly, the wizard continued to utter the chants necessary to keep the boat on course and at a reasonable clip.  Then he turned to the youngest student, &ldquo;Manage the boat for a while; I will rest.&rdquo;

And the wizard lay down in the bottom of the boat to rest.

The wizard was not worried that the student would make a mistake; pacts had been made with certain creatures, and the result was that the wizard was not worried about death from a fall.  The other students, however, had no such protection, and thus watched their brother closely in case an incorrectly muttered word should throw them off course or, even worse, off the ship.  The wizard was notorious for losing students through magical mishaps, but such was the price one paid for studying under one of the greatest wizards.


The sun was rising in the sky when the ship began to reach the borders of the former Ice Queen&rsquo;s realm.  The magician woke.  He looked over the beam.  All one could see was fog.

The magician pulled some powder out of one of his pockets, muttered some words, and sprinkled the powder over the side of the ship.

The effects were quick and decisive; the fog rolled back, and continued rolling back, almost as if it was running away from the ship.  And underneath that fog was water, clear bright water.

&ldquo;Can you believe it?&rdquo; the wizard asked his students, &ldquo;Her domain was pure ice--there was no land underneath!  This sea that we see has never been seen before by human eyes.  I think I shall name it--I am generous in my victory--I shall name it the &lsquo;Ice Queen Sea&rsquo;, after my fallen foe.&rdquo;

The wizard laughed.  His victory was complete, his reputation made. All that remained was one task:

&ldquo;My research has revealed that the Ice Queen has a heart--had a heart.  The heart had great magic, and should not have been destroyed in the fire.  I need to find the heart.  First, though, let us turn this air ship into a water ship, for a water ship will serve our purposes.&rdquo;

He waved his arms and the air ship sank slowly until it came into contact with the water.  In a few moments the boat was rocking rhythmically with the waves and was an air ship no more.

&ldquo;Now let us find the heart,&rdquo; spoke the wizard.  He waved his arms again and muttered, and the air above his head became heavier and heavier, and darker and darker.  Suddenly, there was the sound of glass breaking and the dark air had turned into a bird.

The bird flew in front of the ship.  The bird flew farther away, becoming smaller.

The wizard muttered some more, and the boat wrenched itself in the water to follow the bird, following the bird as fast as the bird flew.  The timbers in the boat screamed from the strain, but the boat held together.

Then the bird stopped, began to lose substance, turned into a thick dark cloud, which then dissipated.

&ldquo;Gentlemen, we have arrived,&rdquo; said the wizard.  &ldquo;Follow me; or, if you are afraid, stay here.&rdquo;

The wizard smiled; he enjoyed frightening his students.  He then dove off the end of the ship into the water.

Down, down he swam.  He didn&rsquo;t need to breathe of course--he had taken care of the need to breathe a long time ago.  Along with the need to eat.  Sleep was still an unfortunate necessity, but there was time to work on that one.  Lots of time.

Down, down he swam.  He could feel the heart--its magical field was palpable.  It was terribly strong, stronger than he had imagined. He stopped a moment to wait for his students, but none of them had followed.  

&ldquo;Cowards,&rdquo; the wizard thought to himself, &ldquo;cowards, but not fools. This is a dangerous place.  Dangerous for them.  But fruitful for me.&rdquo;

He moved closer to the source of magic.  Indeed, the heart was still strong.  A rhythmic throbbing began to fill his ears, and he wondered, &ldquo;Is it possible the heart is still beating?  I would assume that the Ice Queen&rsquo;s destruction would have silenced its pulse.  Interesting.&rdquo;

The pulsing became louder, and he could finally see the heart a few feet in front of him.  He stopped to admire it; it was beautiful. The heart was a huge diamond crystal.  It sparkled under the water. &ldquo;If this is what it looks like underwater,&rdquo; thought the wizard, &ldquo;then it must be breathtaking on land.  It will be a proper addition to my possessions.&rdquo;

He reached out to grab it, and it slipped through his fingers

&ldquo;Not so fast, my friend,&rdquo; a man&rsquo;s voice whispered in his ears.

He jerked around.  He guessed that one of his students was stupid enough to try to take the heart from him.  Greed, and underestimating the wizard&rsquo;s power, was the undoing of many of his students.  This one would suffer a similar fate.  Except that there was no one behind him.

&ldquo;The heart is mine!&rdquo; said the wizard to the empty water.

He heard nothing.

&ldquo;Students!&rdquo; he spoke, &ldquo;come to me now!&rdquo;  He twisted the pendant that he wore--one that was woven from the strands of his students&rsquo; hair--as he spoke his commands.  His cowardly students could not help but obey; it was one of the prices they paid for studying under him.  And yet they did not come.

&ldquo;Your students are dead,&rdquo; spoke the voice.

&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; asked the wizard.  There was no reply.

The wizard turned around again and made another grab for the heart, and again it slipped through his fingers.

&ldquo;Do you know who I am?&rdquo; asked the wizard.

Still there was no reply.

&ldquo;Very well; suffer my wrath.&rdquo;  The wizard began to speak words of power, when water filled his mouth and prevented the words from coming out.

He frantically moved his hands to summon aid, and found that the water, previously liquid, had somehow solidified around his hands. He could not move.

&ldquo;You have made your last mistake,&rdquo; said the voice.  &ldquo;You tried to kill my sister, the Ice Queen.&rdquo;

The voice continued, &ldquo;your plan was well conceived, except one fatal flaw: you assumed the melting of the Ice would destroy my sister. But it didn&rsquo;t--did you forget?  Water is melted ice; ice is frozen water.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I am the Water King.  In some senses, I am also the Ice Queen.  We are different sides of the same coin.  Your silly ploy had the effect of putting her to sleep and waking me up.&rdquo;

The wizard smiled, &ldquo;I made mistakes.  Such is obvious.  But you should be grateful--thanks to my work, you are now alive and free to roam the world.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Silly man,&rdquo; spoke the voice, &ldquo;I was not dead; I was not imprisoned. I was merely slumbering while my sister walked the earth.  I owe you no gratitude.&rdquo;

The wizard&rsquo;s smile faltered briefly, and then sprang again in full force, &ldquo;But of course you do not carry a grudge at me, anymore than a glacier could be angry at the mountain!&rdquo;

&ldquo;But I am a river, not a glacier.  And, unlike my sister, I do hold grudges.  Though we are both sides of the same coin, we are very, very different.  I hold grudges, I am petty, and I am cruel.&rdquo;
