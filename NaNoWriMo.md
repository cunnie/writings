## The Eyes of the Blind Shall Be Opened

She knew it was going to get ugly.

It was always ugly. Even when it wasn't ugly, when things went her way, it was
never perfect — it never _quite_ went her way.

And that seemed to bring out the best in her. She thought of her sister, fat,
dumb, and happy. Well, maybe not happy. Her sister's husband had let himself go
after the second kid. Her sister would say, "I married a Greek God, but now I'm
married to a goddamn Greek!" and then laugh.

But you could tell there was an undercurrent of dissatisfaction. Sure, her
sister laughed, but that didn't mean everything was okay. Her husband had gotten
fat. And, along with the fat, came a certain negligence with regard to grooming:
his clothing was rumpled, he always wore t-shirts, and his shaving had become
inconsistent (which is not a problem if you're a blond Norwegian, but is a
problem if you're a swarthy Greek).

Her sister's husband looked like an overworked Brooklyn building superintendent.

She was surprised how easily her sister had come to terms with it. At times she
wanted to shake her and say, "Lori, look at him, look at Dino! Is that who you
want to be married to? Do you want to be married to a sweaty fat bald
cigar-smoker who on a good day remembers to shower?"

God, Dino drove her crazy. He used to be handsome, too. And quite the clothes
horse. When he was in his twenties and thirties he was an Adonis: chiseled
looks, and deep brown eyes you could swim in. But halfway in his forties things
took a sharp left turn for the worse. He hadn't aged well.

It wasn't about the aging. Well, it was a bit about the aging, but also how you
dealt with it. Some people just gave up and let themselves go. But it didn't
have to be that way. A small number of people were fighters. Yes, your body
wants to change shape, and your skin wants to wrinkle, and your hair wants to
turn white, but those are things you can fix, and, if not fix, mitigate.

She had taken care of herself. It wasn't easy, she'd grant that. Gym every
morning: treadmill, bicycle, and then the half-hour with her trainer.

Her trainer — God he was hot. She had been working with him for the last two
years. There was a period when their relationship began to become personal, when
he shared about the overwhelming sense of loneliness that sometimes strikes him
in mid-morning when he has no clients. She wanted to reach out and touch him,
caress his head in her bosom, tell him that things were okay.

But things shifted, and he never mentioned that again. She wished she had
reached out to him that one time, that maybe their relationship would have
broken through the client-trainer boundary and become something more.

She felt her face. Her forehead was smooth — the Botox was working well, and
next treatment was three weeks away — but she was beginning to get a turkey
wattle. Botox wouldn't fix that. Maybe she should try the surgery, a little
nip-and-tuck to put things in their place. She had to be careful though — the
last thing she wanted was to become one of those grotesque people who take
plastic surgery too far. Still have the surgery, but keep a little bit of
wattle, not too much.

When she was twenty she would look at the plastic-surgeries-gone-wrong section
of the gossip rags, gripped with a morbid fascination. "I'll never get plastic
surgery! It's so fake — I'll never do it! I'll grow old gracefully, like Grace
Kelly."

It's easy to make pronouncements like that when you're twenty years old when
your skin is as smooth as a Wisconsin lake at early dawn, but your perspective
changes when your in your fifties and your skin is starting to sag and wrinkle.

She looked at her hands. The hands were the give-aways. That's the trick the
carnies used to judge people's age — the hands. Over time the hands lose their
baby fat, and the bones and veins become more pronounced. And it didn't help
that there was a big liver spot in the middle of the back of her hand.

She was in the elevator. Up, up, and up. Why were the executive offices always
near the top floor? It meant executives spent more time in elevators. In a
perfectly efficient world, the executives would be in the ground floor. It was
about status: the view overlooking the city, the corner office. It was easy to
dismiss these things as unimportant, as her father the engineer had a tendency
to do. But these status symbols were important to some people, and thus they
were important to her, too.

She got off at her floor. She checked her phone: one minute early. Good. She
detested being late. It was a lack of discipline that made people late. Her
sister was chronically late. It didn't mean her sister was a bad person — quite
the opposite: her sister was a wonderful person. She loved her sister. But
loving someone didn't mean you turned a blind eye to their faults.

She opened the door. Everyone was there. Good. They were a good team. It was
going to be a tough meeting.

"Gentlemen," she said, and then nodded to Rebecca, "Lady."

She took her seat. "We're all here. Let's start, shall we?"

The meeting began. A legal issue in a business unit, which, if not handled
correctly, could force her to resign or, even worse, sink the company.

A bull-faced man was talking. The head of global sales, a big blustering man. He
began talking louder, then pointed at Ned, the man who ran the business unit
with the legal problem.

She stepped in, "You raise a good point: it's worthwhile to explore what led up
to this issue, and we'll examine that in a later meeting. Let's focus on how to
fix the problem right now."

Dealing with him was tricky — he was an alpha male-type. It meant he needed to
be put in his place periodically. Surprisingly, it seemed that he _wanted_ to be
put in his place: it confirmed the existing hierarchy. But putting him in his
place needed to be done with the utmost delicacy, without impugning his
character or diminishing his dignity. He was good at what he did, and it would
be unfortunate to lose him.

It helped that she was a woman; he didn't feel threatened by a woman, but he had
had a hard time being put in his place by a man. The previous CEO was a man, and
that made for some very rocky meetings: he had resigned on at least one
occasion.

Yes, that was the dirty secret of feminism: sometimes being a woman made it
_easier_ to be the leader of men because it short-circuited the male competitive
drive.

The meeting continued. She mostly listened. She did step in once when she sensed
the beginning of a feeding frenzy around Ned. She didn't like when people ganged
up on each other. It was bad for business and rarely accomplished anything.
There was a hint of savage when it happened, and she had a strong dislike of
anything savage.

In some ways handling the problem was easy because there were many constraints.
Obeying the law, for example. They didn't have a choice. They needed to appear
as cooperative as possible, so no document-shredding, no email-deleting. The
best approach always was, "We're sorry, we made a mistake, we're going to do our
best to make it better."

The solution was simple: they were going to spend lots of money making things
better. Lots of money. Not enough to bankrupt the company, but enough to hurt.
The bonuses were going to be small this year, and everyone in the room knew
that. There was the miasma of sadness and loss in the room.

Her mentor, the previous CEO, had said to her, "Remember: when you have a
problem, and it can be fixed with money, you don't have a problem — you have an
expense." Right now she had an expense. A very big expense.

The purpose of the meeting had been to achieve consensus, and consensus had been
achieved.

The meeting adjourned. She asked, "Ned, could you please stay."

Everyone else in the room had left. Ned began stammering, saying that
accidentally the waivers had been signed.

She waved her hand, "Let's not worry about the waivers for a minute. I have a
few questions about what was going on."

Ned said that he couldn't talk about it, that it was a project for the military
and that it was top-secret.

She said, "Ned, I'm not asking you to reveal anything that's classified. I'm
merely trying to understand what exactly happened."

He seemed relieved, then nervous.

She said simply, "The notes we have indicated that someone died. Did someone
die?"

He said, "Yes. No. We're not sure."

"Was there a specific person or persons who died?"

"There was one specific person who may or may not have died."

"Is there a body?"

"No."

"There's no body?"

"Not really, no."

"So he or she might be walking around in New York somewhere."

Ned chuckled and then stopped. "He's a he — I think I can say that — and he's
definitely not walking around New York."

"Was the body accidentally destroyed as part of the experiment?"

"'Destroyed' is probably not quite the right word. Maybe 'transformed' or
'transmogrified'"

"The body was transformed into something else, something not a body."

"Yes."

She put her hand on his forearm and leaned in conspiratorially, a somewhat
calculated move on her part, smiled and asked, "Was what he was transformed into
animal, mineral, or vegetable?"

He smiled back and said, "None of the above."

"Really?"

"Really."

It was at that moment that she decided she was going to learn more about what
exactly this project was. She knew that this was irresponsible on her part, that
she was tasked with running a company and the last thing she should allow
herself to do is get lost in the weeds to satisfy her curiosity. Two weeks.
She'd time-box her exploration to two weeks, so it wouldn't get out of hand.

"Ned," she asked, "how do I go about getting top-secret clearance?"

## The Vale of Tears

It wasn't hard getting Top Secret clearance — there were tedious chores, such as
getting fingerprinted, filling out a 20-page questionnaire, and then there was
the waiting while the FBI interviewed her friends to discover if she had a
gambling problem, a drug problem, or anything that might lend her to blackmail.

She kept busy. The good thing about being a CEO: there was no shortage of work
to be done. She spent a lot of time in planes.

When the clearance finally came through, she summoned Ned to her office.
"Alright, now you can tell me everything."

He said, "You already know everything that I know."

"What?"

"That's pretty much all I know: that they think a guy died, and that it was
using our equipment."

"Then what does the Top Secret clearance buy me?"

"It buys this: I can tell you, 'that's all I know'."

"I thought you ran the division."

"I do, but it's a lot of military stuff. This particular unit is fairly opaque —
other than the fact that they're pulling in good money from the Department of
Homeland Security, I don't know much about what's going on."

"C'mon Ned, that sounds dangerously close to negligence."

"I know; look, I wanted to find out more about what they're doing, but I was
being blocked at every turn. It's not good enough to have clearance, you must
have need-to-know clearance."

"And you didn't have that?"

"I'm a manager, not a scientist. They didn't think I needed to know. I pushed
pretty hard once, too, but they made it clear that they might pull the contract,
and I didn't want to be the guy who killed the goose that laid the golden egg."

He continued, "Look, I screwed up, I know. But I trusted my guys. They said  it
was okay, they said nobody should get hurt. I've been with  them for years, I've
been to their houses, I know the name of their wives and children. And believe
me, these guys are torn up — they can't believe what happened either. One of
them said to me, 'Ned, I can't say more than this, but this shouldn't have
happened, we don't quite know what happened, and we may never know what
happened."

"How can they not know what happened?"

"Crazy, isn't it?"

"Who's the customer? Who's running the champion?"

"General Randall W. Gates."

"Have I met him?"

"Probably not. He's not much of a meet-and-greet guy. He's strictly business.
Smart, too. Crisp."

"I want to meet with him."

Ned gave a funny look.

"What, you've never met him?"

"I've met some of his people, but I've never met him."

"Well, give me someone I can meet."

"There's a bird colonel. Taggart."

"Would you be kind enough to set up a meeting?"

"Sure," he said, "I'll do it."

She knew he'd do it. he knew he was in the hot seat, and he believed that she
would protect him, that she had his back. And he was right, too — she would
protect him, or at least do her best. She found that when people  had a guardian
it inspired a fierce sense of loyalty. Ned would do what it took to get her to
see Colonel Taggart.

---

It was a week later, and they were in an army base in New Jersey.

"Pardon my surprise, but I thought Congress had shut the base down a couple of
years ago."

Colonel Taggart looked across the table at her and said, "They _did_ shut it
down a couple of years ago. We're the clean-up crew." then he smiled to himself.

He continued, "I know you're busy; I know I'm busy, so why did you come all the
way here?"

"I need to know what happened."

"The people who need to know already know."

"Colonel Taggart," she said, "I'm asking you to appreciate the position I'm in:
I'm the final custodian of risk. When someone dies using one of our products, we
need to make sure that we're doing the utmost to make sure it doesn't happen
again. Except I can't make sure it doesn't happen again because no one can tell
me what happened and even worse no is sure what happened."

"The people who need to know, already know," he repeated.

"I'm shutting down the project," she said.

That got his attention. She knew she had a hunch she'd have to play that card.

"You can't shut down the project."

"Actually I can," she said. "My counsel has reviewed the project's contract."

"There's a penalty for early termination," he sputtered.

"Yes, there's a steep financial penalty. It'll certainly hurt the company," she
said. "I don't see another choice. I can't have a second death. We need to
understand what's going on."

She lowered her tone, "Colonel, in civilian life there are terrible
repercussions when people die. People go to jail, companies are shuttered. As
the steward of this company, I can't allow a second person to die on my watch.
Not only is it harmful to the company, but it's not the right thing."

The colonel held his jaw tight. "What do you think you'll find? A smoking gun? A
device that has a tendency to explode? Loose, uninsulated wiring that
electrocutes people? There's no carelessness, no negligence."

"Let me be the judge of that."

"You're not getting project clearance."

"That's your decision, Colonel."

"And you're not shutting the project down, either."

"That is my decision, not yours."

He began talking loudly about national security and ground-breaking research.
She let him go on.

"I think we're done here, Colonel."

The Colonel shook his head. "Don't touch the project."

"I'll do what I must to protect the company."

She picked up her things and walked out the door. The meeting hadn't gone as she
had hoped, but if the Colonel was banking on her not having the balls to shut
down the project, he was wrong. She was willing to take the hit. Too risky. The
board would back her, too. Besides, her mentor was now the chairman. He
understood risk.

She dashed off a quick email to Ned saying to prepare to shut down the project,
then got in the car.

She hadn't even left the base when her phone rang. She looked at the callerid —
it said, "911". She answered it.

The voice on the other end said, "Hello Julia, I'm General Gates."

"General Gates? What an unexpected pleasure."

"Thank you Julia. I'm going to ask you a favor — 500 feet from where you are
now, there's a blue hangar on the left. The doors are open. I want you to drive
through the doors."

"I'd like to ask about the..."

General Gates interrupted her, "We can talk when you're in the blue hangar, not
before. Thank you for your consideration."

"Ok."

General Gates had a strange voice, oddly melodic, and yet not quite human. It
sounded like ten people saying the exact same thing at the exact same time. Or
maybe a hundred people.

She found the hangar, took a left, and drove through its double doors.

The hangar was dark, but as her car passed through the doors two things
happened: 3 overhead lights flicked on, and the doors closed.

"General, the doors are closing behind me."

There was a pause. She looked at her phone: no signal.

Suddenly there were five bars. And her phone rang again. "911" again.

She answered it. "What was that about?"

"You spoke with Taggart about risk and about mitigation. In my position it's all
about risk and mitigation. Risks that to you may appear inconsequential, but to
me border on gross negligence. For example, we're talking on your cellphone,
right?"

"Right!"

"And your provider is Verizon, right?"

"Right!"

"And we're talking over Verizon's network, right?"

"Right!"

"Wrong. We're not talking on Verizon's network. This hangar is a Faraday cage —
no cell phone traffic comes in or out of this hangar. The electromagnetic waves
can't break past the cage. In this hangar is a fake cell phone tower. The  fake
cell phone tower masquerades as a Verizon tower, and is connected to a secure
fiber trunk line  which encrypts all communications coming inside our outside
the building."

"What?"

"It's about mitigating risk. We don't want our conversation eavesdropped. If it
is eavesdropped, we want it encrypted so they can't make sense out of it. In
spite of those precautions, I'm taking a grave risk speaking to you."

The general continued. "Our initial conversation took place over the public
network. That will be the last time we will have a conversation on a public
network."

"What if I need to get in touch with you?"

"You will not get in touch with me; I will get in touch with you."

She thought to herself for a second, and then grunted.

"You will not shut down the project."

She laughed. She said, "I've already had this conversation with Colonel
Taggart."

"I am not Taggart, and you will not shut this project down."

"General Gates, with all due respect this project is a disaster waiting to
happen, and my company can't afford a disaster."

"Julia, you mentioned you wanted to understand what happened to the project. We —
I — are prepared to give you access to the project, to allow you to talk with
the scientists, but there are things you must understand."

"Yes?"

"You may not repeat anything that the scientists tell you. You may not repeat
what one scientist on the project has told you to another scientist on the
project. You may not 'hint' to anyone anything about the project. You may not
mention that you've been given access to the project. You may not tell Ned that
you've been given access to the project. You may not write anything down about
the project. You may not write notes on your phone or your computer. You may not
punch in addresses to navigate to on your phone, GPS, or computer. You are
familiar with the blackout period leading up to the release of a company's
financials? This is similar, except that it's much blacker, and it never ends.
Are we clear?"

"General, this seems a bit overboard..."

He interrupted again. "Are we clear?"

"We are clear, as clear as an azure sky of deepest summer."

General Gates chuckled. "Don't think that Clockwork Orange reference went
unnoticed. The thing to remember is that things didn't work out well for Alex,
but we want them to work out well for you. Hew to the path, Julia; it's quite
important."

"I will, sir." She said. "I need to know the next step."

He chuckled.

"I need to know what I can expect, and when I can expect it. I need to know when
I'll have access to the project."

Her mentor had said, "Always ask 'when?'. If they can't tell you, then ask them,
'When will you be able to tell me when?'"

"Fair enough, Julia. Monday, two weeks from today, A man will meet you at 8am in
your office. You will leave your cellphone at your office. He will be driving a
windowless van. You will sit in the back of the van. It will be comfortable, but
there will be no windows. You will be driven in the van for approximately 2
hours. You will have six hours to interview the scientists on the project.

The phone went dead. No bars. The hangar doors behind her opened up. She backed
out of the hangar, and continued her drive to the airport.

---

She sat in coach. She travelled mostly in coach, sometimes in business class,
but mostly in coach. She wanted to set the example for her company. Frugal. She
had seen some companies go overboard, "sucking on the corporate teat," was how
her mentor had described it.

She didn't begrudge her people flying business, but never first class, not even
on the long Asia flights. If they used their points to upgrade, well that was
their prerogative. But the company was only going to pay for business class.

It was curious: Sales and Marketing tended to spend proportionally much larger
amounts on flights, meals, entertainment, conferences, than the engineers and
scientists, who spent at times unbelievably little. But the scientists and
engineers would kill you on the capital expenditures. Engineering was expensive.
Salaries were much of it, but capital expenditures was a close second.

She thought of the head of Global Sales. He always travelled business class. He
was a large man, and business class made a big difference.

She smiled. She couldn't help but like John. Heck, that's one of the reasons he
was so effective in Sales. He could say the most outrageous things and, with a
wink and a smile, get away with it.

She frequently travelled with John when they called upon their enterprise
customers. Sometimes she'd fly in business class with John, but other times she
sat back in coach.

He didn't like that, when she sat back in coach. He didn't like that, but not
enough to change his ticket, so she used that time to work on other things,
sometimes personnel issues, sometimes financial.

He was a warm person, and she was reserved. He was drawn to that, the
reservation. She was never quite within his grasp, and it made him try harder to
make her like him.

It wasn't sexual, her relationship, not sexual at all. There was one time, too
late, she had been tired, and besides nothing had happened. Nothing at all.

Their relationship wasnm't sexual, but he yearned for something from her. Was it
the unconditional love of a mother? Was it acknowledgement of his talent?

She wasn't stingy with her praise, but she wasn't over-the-top, either. Early in
her career she tended to be over-the-top, but it merely debased the currency of
her praise, and she adjusted accordingly.

She made it clear that he was valued, not only in those _pro forma_ yearly
performance appraisals, but more importantly in the special way when you come to
someone with a problem. Earlier last week, for example, she walked into his
office and said, "John, we're having trouble in Support with the EMC account —
the Support organization is fixing some of it on their end, but I'm wondering if
you could smooth any waves on the executive side before it gets out of hand?"

Asking people for help was important — it helped made them feel valued. But it
had to be something you couldn't do yourself — "Could you please get me a cup of
coffee?" did not engender feelings of being appreciated.

And there was the mom-thing. For better or worse, when younger men reported to
you, they projected feelings about their mother onto you. It was a tricky dance:
on one hand,  in a strange way, they loved you, they trusted you. On another
hand, a professional relationship was not a mother-son relationship — those are
different beasts. And you needed your guard up.

She remembered one particularly difficult employee. Only after he had left the
company did she discover that he had been estranged from his mother for the last
ten years. Sigh. There was a reason to keep one's private and professional lives
separate, but some people could not but help drag their emotional baggage into
work, and this employee was one of them.

She remembered being in her mentor's office, "I'm having a problem with an
employee."

He said, "Close the door."

After the door was closed, he said, "What's going on Julia?"

"He's disruptive at the office. He's inappropriate with customers, and," she
paused, and then blurted, "He undermines my authority. He interrupts me
constantly at meetings. And other ways, too."

"Other ways?"

"Two of my other reps came to me and said that he said that the only reason I
got the job was because..."

"Yes?"

"because you and I were having an affair," she blurted out.

Her mentor twitched, "That's what they're saying?"

"That's what _he_ is saying."

They both sat in silence. There never had been anything sexual between them. She
was originally drawn to him because of his hands — his hands reminded her  of
her father's hands: strong but not too rough. And other things about him
reminded her of her father: he was gentle but also firm. She had reported to him
early in her career, and they clicked right away, and he took her under his
wing. She couldn't explain it, but somehow she _trusted_ him from day one. And
he trusted her.

He spoke up, "As disturbing as this is, this type of salacious rumor-mongering
is not a good enough reason to terminate someone. It's a lesser sin than
undermining your authority in front of the other subordinates — that is bad. Is
there anything else he has done?"

"He once set me up for an ambush."

"How so?"

"He arranged a meeting between him, me, and his second biggest client. One of
the topics he asked me to bring up was to migrate the client from the old
B-Style contract to the new C-style contract. When I brought it up, the client
was so angry that he walked out of the meeting. I found out later that he _knew_
the client was adamantly opposed to changing the contract, but he had never told
me. He set me up."

"How is he as a sales rep?"

"He's mediocre, but he's not incompetent."

Her mentor paused. "He's probably not worth transferring to another group. Have
you spoken with him?"

"Yes. And I've put him on a performance plan, too."

"Good. That was my next question. And he still undermines you?"

"Yes."

"That's a problem. We can't have that. It makes you look weak, and your other
subordinates may wonder why you're not doing anything about it. He is one of
your reps, right? Has a quota? Bump it up."

"Bump it up?"

"Bump it up enough so that he can't make it. And use that as grounds for
dismissal. Also, you'll need to justify bumping up the quota, so give him a few
extra accounts. Give him dead ones, that he has no chance of selling into. If
he's a miracle worker and brings in those accounts, that's great — you'll have a
bigger bonus that quarter. But use that as a reason to bump up his quota again.
He'll be gone in three months, six months on the outside."

"I wish I could just fire him"

"Yeah, in the old days it was easier getting rid of the bad eggs, unless they
were union. If they were union it was next to impossible to get rid of them.
With him, you need to be careful — you don't want to give him grounds for a
lawsuit when he's dismissed. You want to make it look like we've been fair and
even-handed, and we dismisshim for performance reasons. It has to look fair,
that we followed procedures. It works like this: you know this guy is bad news;
I know this guy is bad news, and the guy probably suspects he's bad news. He
does more harm than good to the corporation. But knowing someone is bad news
isn't quantifiable, it doesn't lend itself as a reason to dismiss. We can't
write 'Bad News' on a piece of paper, stick it in his personnel file, and then
dismiss him. Instead, we play the game: we set performance expectations, show
that he hasn't met them, and only then dismiss him. We protect the company from
retaliation."

He added, "There's something you should know about firing people — it never
feels good afterwards. I'm always haunted by doubt — maybe there's something I
could have done to salvage the situation. Firing someone is always the last
resort, only to be used when all other options have been exhausted. In this
case, I think firing is the right choice."

They sat in silence a little longer.

"Anything else?" he asked.

She shook her head. "Thanks," she said.

He nodded.

---

The week flew by. And advantage of being CEO was that there was no end of work
to be done. It bled a little bit into the weekend, but she sequestered work to
very specific time periods. It allowed her to be responsive and still preserve
time for herself.

The 40-hour work week did not apply to CEOs, financiers, shop owners, high-level
executives, sales reps, scientists, or most professions it seemed. It was an
illusion, an aspiration. She remembered the first-time she saw the book titled,
"The 4-hour Work Week" — she almost burst out laughing. It was for sale in a
bookstore in an airport. She looked around — clearly the book's target audience
were harried businessmen and businesswomen hoping to magically free up time. It
was similar to the tabloids in the supermarket check-out that touted, "The Ice
Cream diet: eat all the ice cream you want and still lose weight!" They were con
jobs that differed only in their sophistication.

She had cleared her schedule for all of Monday. She had been at work since 7am
polishing some last minute details. At 8am sharp she received a call from the
security desk saying someone was here to see her.

She put everything away and went downstairs. She was surprised to find that the
person waiting for her was not a man dressed like a Secret Service agent with
black sunglasses. Instead, it was a young women dressed casually.

"I'll be your driver today," she said. They exited the building together; the
van was parked in front.

"Before we leave, I'll need your cell phone, your tablet, your laptop, and any
other electronic device you might have. You may want to turn them off before you
give them to me — they will most likely drain their batteries searching for a
signal."

Julia turned her cellphone off and her laptop and gave both of them to the
driver, who put them in a briefcase-sized black box.

"Faraday cage?" Julia asked.

The driver nodded.

"I need to ask you one more time if there's any electronic device that you have
forgotten to give me. I must also remind you that failure to turn over an
electronic device constitutes a violation of the Patriot Act, for which the
penalty can be fine or imprisonment. Do I have all your electronic devices?"

"You have all my electronic devices."

"Good." The drive slid open the side panel of the van. The van had two rows
seats and no windows. And no magazines.

Julia stepped inside, sat in the front row. There was an opaque barrier between
the inside of the van and the driver in front. She could see nothing outside the
van.

She felt a sense of disorientation — without her laptop, without her cell,
without a window to look out, there was nothing to do. After five minutes she
moved to the longer rear seat, stretched out, and took a nap.

The sliding of the door woke her. "We're here," said the driver.

Julia sat up. She took the mirror out of her purse and checked herself. She
didn't spend much time grooming, and she was spare when it came to make-up, but
it was important not to be unkempt. No bed-hair. Good. She snapped the mirror
shut, put it in her bag, and exited the van.

They were in a large hangar. "What's with the hangars?" she thought to herself.
"It's always a hangar."

"Follow me," said the driver. She walked to the door at the end of the hangar,
waved a badge, and was buzzed in. Inside there was a checkpoint with two armed
soldiers. One soldier was watching them, the other soldier was watching a
screen.

The driver put her hand on a glass panel inset into the desk. A green light
flickered under the glass panel, and a soldier nodded.

"You need to place your hands on the glass. Make sure your prints touch the
surface. You might find it helpful to splay your fingers to that the thumbprints
are visible."

Julia did as the driver instructed. She noticed that the glass was clear, free
of fingerprints or smudges, probably some type of oleophobic material. The green
light flickered, the soldier looked at his screen, then nodded.

"Follow me," said the driver. They walked through a set of double doors into a
corridor.

"Do you need to use the restroom or would you like some water before we begin?"

Julia shook her head.

"Good, then I'll introduce you to the first scientist."

She opened a door to the right and began walking down another hallway, this one
with large glass panels showing the lab to the right. Julia recognized her
company's equipment — the logo was easily identifiable. A man in a labcoat was
adjusting the dials on one of the pieces of equipment.

The driver knocked on the door, and then opened it. "Dr. Bernstein? Ms. Chou is
here to see you."

The scientist, though in his mid-forties, had a boyishness to him. He held up
his hand, "I'll be with you in a second — I just need to make this one setting."

He carefully set the dial, then walked, almost bounced, over to Julia.

"Hi," he said, "You can call me Max. We don't need need to be formal here. Sorry
to keep you waiting, but if I hadn't made that adjustment right then, I would
have had to re-start the experiment, which means I would have lost sixteen
hours."

The driver interrupted, "Dr. Bernstein, please buzz me when you have finished
with Ms. Chou so that I may escort her to the next interview. And, this applies
to you, too, Ms. Chou: please do not discuss any classified information in my
presence."

"Of course, of course," said Dr. Bernstein. "You may call me Max."

The driver nodded and then left the room.

"I always tell her to call me Max, and she insists on calling me Dr. Bernstein,"
said Max. "The military is such an odd organization, so formal. And
hierarchical."

"I must confess I'm pleased to meet you," said Julia. "I've read some of your
papers. The one published in _Nature_ was particularly impressive, as was the
one in _Scientific American_. Some of the more technical aspects were beyond me,
I'm sorry to say."

"You've read my papers?" He noticeably brightened. "Us scientists spend so much
time researching, and then writing papers, but sometimes we wonder if they have
any impact outside our rather small community.  So much work, but the audience
is maybe fifty, maybe a couple of hundred other scientists at most. At times it
feels like stuffing messages in a bottle and throwing them out into the ocean
hoping that someone, somewhere will read it and find it useful."

Julia smiled. She had a genuine interest in her employees. Although she no
longer had time to interview every new hire, she made sure to review their
resumes. And she had a soft spot for scientists and engineers — her father had
been an engineer, and she had been one too at the beginning of her career.
Scientists in some ways  were the easiest to review because publishing was an
important aspect of being  a scientist. She wished that engineers published more —
it enforced a certain clarity of thinking that was too often lacking in
engineering circles. Scholarly publishing,  that is. In the computer science
realm there were too many publications that fell into the
"tabloid-sensationalism" category ("Why Google is scared to death of this new
networking technology!") — heavy on opinion, light on facts, and weak on logic.

Among scientists, however, rigor was prized, and a good article was often
extremely dense on information. Dr. Bernstein's papers were among the best.

"What are you working on?" she asked.

"Oh yes, the project" he said. "Well, the short version is this: we're using
long cycle low-power electromagnetic fields to shape sympathetic receptors in
the human brain."

"Sympathetic?"

"Sympathetic to high frequency electromagnetic waves."

"Not low frequency?"

He smiled. "The human skull is too small to fit an antenna that handles low
frequency waves. And by low frequency, I mean any wavelength under 10GHz. Look,
let's say we wanted to listen to AM Radio, which is 535kHz at the bottom of the
scale, and let's say we  wanted to have a 1/8 length antenna — it would need to
be over 200 feet! We can't fit that in a human skull. Let's try something more
reasonable — let's try a cell phone antenna. Typically the low-end of the cell
phone spectrum is 700MHz, which means the antenna would need to be about two
inches — that's something you can easily fit inside a cell phone case. Actually,
outside the case would be better, but now we're getting way off topic."

She asked, "What affects the length of the antenna?"

"Oh yes, sorry, let me backtrack. I was talking about frequency, which is
inversely proportional to the wavelength, and that's what's important — the
wavelength. The longer the wavelength, the longer your antenna needs to be to
pick it up."

He was on a roll: "Short wavelengths get blocked fairly easily. That's a
generalization, but it's a good rule of thumb. That's one of the reasons why
5GHz WiFi doesn't travel through walls as well as 2.4GHz. If you dig deep, you
find it's more complicated, and it depends on the property of the material
that's blocking, but like I said, it's a good rule of thumb."

"Long radio waves are almost unblockable". The difficulty with them is that they
have low bandwidth. Let's take the nuclear subs, for example. They drag a wire
behind them that's a couple of miles long. That's so they can pick up an 8kHz
signal — the nuclear launch codes. It'll take a couple of minutes to transmit
the entire code, but who cares? As long as it gets through then the missiles get
launched. And you can't block the signal."

"As a side note: I hope that those antennae — they can also be called
'antennas', but I always like to use the Latin plural. 'Antenna' is a first
declension noun. Did I mention I took four years of Latin at St. Ignatius Prep?
Yes, a Jew in a Jesuit school — I wasn't the first, and I won't be the last.
'Hybrid vigor' I call it, though from an intellectual standpoint than a genetic
one."

She found herself completely drawn in by him, his enthusiasm, his leap from
topic to topic, his wealth of knowledge.

"So where was I? Oh yes, the long antennae on nuclear subs — I hope they never
are used. Good engineering, bad use-case. But no sense in getting worked up over
things outside my control."

"We were talking about antennae and wavelengths. Now don't get me wrong, the
human brain can detect wavelengths of many sorts. Let's take hearing for
example: we can hear wavelengths from about 20Hz to about 21kHz if you're a kid.
At my age, my hearing only goes up to 12kHz, so I can't hear high-pitched whines
above a certain frequency. Note that we can 'sense' frequencies lower than 20Hz —
we can feel the rumble — but we don't 'hear' them. But sound waves, even though
they have a frequency and a wavelength, aren't electromagnetic — instead, they
fall under the more classic definition: a wave caused by displacement of mass,
which happens to be air in the case of soundwaves."

"But our senses aren't limited to sound — we can can also see, and light is a
good example of electromagnetic radiation. Light has a really short wavelength —
in the hundreds of nanometers. And the frequency? 430–750 terahertz. That's
right, _terahertz_. So the frequency of visible light will cycle about ten
thousand times more frequently than, say,  a 5GHz WiFi signal. So we don't need
a long antenna at all. They can be small enough to fit inside a specialized
human cell."

"Where was I? Oh yes, the antennae. We want people to be able to perceive
radiation, but not something they can already see — if they have eyes, there's
no purpose installing an antenna what will see the visible spectrum inside the
skull — it doesn't buy them anything. Plus light has a hard time penetrating the
skull — they wouldn't see much at all."

"We can't go to a low frequency, because we can't stick a 2-inch rod inside
someone's skull. In fact, we don't want to do any drilling or surgery at all if
we can help it. So that forces our hand: small antennae, high frequencies."

"Max, what was that machine you were working on before I came in?"

"Machine? Oh yes, that wasn't a machine _per se_: it's the console to a machine.
A modified MRI. It's what we use to create the antennae."

"Create the antennae?"

"We arrange the cells. We delicately push and pull them until they line up
correctly. The ganglions and axions, mostly the ganglions. Salt water and
everything — make a good antenna when they're lined up exactly right."

"You inject salt water?"

"Heavens, no. I meant to say that we are salt water. When you cry, the tears are
salty. Curiously they're always the same concentration of salt. Salty enough to
conduct electricity decently, which is a requirement for antennae. Your body's
cells, they are all pretty salty, about as salty as the ocean."

"So when you create these antennae, where do you place them?"

He turned to her: "Now _that_ is a very good question."

He says, "In the beginning we had no idea — we thought we'd create them in the
frontal lobes — the cerebral cortex — and that was weird. You could tell the
behavior changed. Then we began to branch out: the thalamus, the hippocampus,
the amygdalae"

"You did this on humans?"

"Goodness no! We're scientists, not lunatics. We were testing on mice. Mice are
not always the best subjects when it comes to these types of experiments though
because they can never describe what they're thinking or sensing. We extrapolate
from their behavior."

"And what did you find?"

"Honestly we found very little. The behavior changed, but only slightly.
Sometimes they could do the maze faster, sometimes they'd refuse to do it. But
these were subtle changes, and not always consistent."

"Then what happened?"

"We were at a dead-end. We had been stuck for six months. It was time to wrap
things up. We spoke to our sponsor and told them we weren't making progress, and
that it was time to wrap-up the project."

"Early termination?"

He looked at her, "I guess from a company standpoint you want to keep the money
coming in, but we weren't getting anywhere."

"You did the right thing," she reassured him. "We're in this business for the
long haul; we want to be straight shooters. Besides, there are always other
projects to bid on."

"You're the CEO — don't you already know all this?"

"The Federal Division is different than the company's other business units,"
Julia said. "Most of the projects are classified, so although we see the
financials, they're rolled-up, not broken out by project. Sometimes we might see
a codename for a project, usually not."

"This project's name was 'Winterfell'"

"We never saw that name in the financials."

"I wouldn't think so," said Dr. Bernstein. "I've worked on several DHS projects,
and this is one of the most secretive."

"So what happened when you suggested an early project termination?"

"They surprised us. They asked if they procured us a live human subject if we
could continue the research."

"We pointed out that although a live human subject would help move the project
forward, there were ethical considerations that precluded us from using human
subjects."

"Then what happened?"

"They introduced us to the test subject. He was a very interesting young man.
Although he wasn't a scientist, he understood the biological and electromagnetic
underpinnings of our work. He also understood the risks, and yet he was
completely willing to go ahead anyway."

Dr. Bernstein's voice sunk to a low whisper, "Julia, I must tell you that
there's something strange about this project — I get the feeling they — the
sponsor — isn't telling us everything. This research I'm doing — it has no
value. No military value, that is, and no medicinal value. I've done a lot of
these projects, and usually I get a sense of what they're looking for, what
they're trying to do. Not this one. This project, from my standpoint, is a
spaghetti-on-the-wall project — throw a lot of spaghetti on the wall, and see
what sticks. It's basic research. But they're much too interested in this.
There's something more in play here, and for the life of me I can't figure out
what it is. But I can tell you this: they want it very badly, and they're not
telling us what they're looking for."

Julia asked, "Do you think the subject knows what they're looking for?"

"He knows more than me, of that I am sure. I don't know how much they told him,
but they've told him enough so that he's willing to take big risks. Look, even
though it's not invasive surgery, pushing parts of your brain around is
dangerous stuff — a lot can go wrong, terribly wrong, very quickly. And he knows
all this, and he's willing to do it. I just don't get it."

She became serious, "Is this the young man that died?"

"It's the man who disappeared. We don't know if he died. One minute he was in
the room, the next minute he was gone."

"Is it possible he left out the back door or something similar?"

"You saw how locked-down they have this place: it would be next-to-impossible to
sneak out undetected."

"Do you think that 'pretending' he disappeared and spirited him away?"

"If that's the case, I don't see what 'pretending' buys them — it's brought the
project to a screeching halt and opened the possibility of shutting us down,
which was the last thing they wanted. Plus the instruments had very strange
readings leading up to the moment he disappeared."

"The instruments?"

"Mostly health monitor stuff: pulse rate, blood pressure, breathing, EKG."

"Which readings were off?"

"The pulse rate & blood pressure were normal, and so was his EKG, but his
brainwaves were like nothing I've seen before."

"Were you in the room when this was happening?"

"No, I was in the next room."

"And then?"

"And then all the readings went flat. I thought maybe a cable fell loose or
something, so I was fiddling with the workstation for about a minute. But I
couldn't find anything wrong, so I walked to the other room to find that he was
gone."

"Gone?"

"The plank was empty. The sensors were still there, but they were resting on the
plank, not attached to anything. The way the sensors were laid out — it made it
seemed like he vanished rather than disconnecting each sensor and then leaving."

"May I see the room?"

"Yes, of course. This was the room I was in when it happened."

He walked to the far end of the room to another door with a sign on it that
said, "Danger. Strong Magnetic Field. No Pacemakers, Metallic Implants, or
Neurostimulators."

He turned to her and said, "You don't have a pacemaker, do you?"

"No."

"And nothing ferro-magnetic? Nothing that can become a projectile?"

"Not on my clothing, but maybe I should leave my handbag here."

She placed her handbag on one of the lab chairs and followed him through the
door through a short six-foot corridor at the end of which was another door. He
opened it.

"Here we are."

It was a spare room with an MRI: a large torus with a plank leading into it.
Julia was reminded of Dunkin' Donuts, and the thought made her smile.

"He was on the plank, of course. Or, more precisely, he _wasn't_ on the plank
when I came back in."

"If I understand correctly, it is here that the antennae are created."

"Yes."

"Is one antenna created during each session, or more?"

"It depends. There's a limitation of the number of adjustments in one setting.
Sometimes you only need to adjust one or two things to make an antenna,
sometimes you need a dozen. During a given session we limit the number of
adjustments to one hundred for several reasons, the most important of which is a
buffer limitation, but there's also a re-calibration requirement."

"So if I'm doing the math right, you can make about ten antenna per session."

"That's more-or-less accurate. In this case it we had just finished creating the
third antenna when he disappeared."

"He had three functioning antennas, I mean, antennae?"

"Oh my, no — he had 147 antennae."

"What?"

"This was his fifteenth session."

"In how many days?"

"In eight days. We had been doing two sessions per day, followed by a
multi-modal stress test to make sure that there were no ill effects."

"Isn't that rather aggressive?"

"It was _extremely_ aggressive. I balked. I said it wasn't safe, we don't know
the consequences of this type of cerebral manipulation, that we should go slowly
and be careful — I said one antenna per week, max."

"They went non-linear."

Julia smiled at this reference: whereas most people would say, "they went
ballistic", electrical engineers have a tendency to say, "they went non-linear",
a reference to an electrical system whose response to an input is out of
proportion.
