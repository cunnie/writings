## The Long Walk Home

The first thing he noticed was the boots, big ugly boots, the kind that rich
people who go skiing use. They were clumsy and ugly, but at least his feet were
warm.

He was walking in a snowstorm. Or, more accurately, a sleetstorm.

The snow was a slushy, dirty mix, and he could see the dark asphalt
underneath. Water, not black ice. It wasn't quite cold enough to freeze.

He turned to look behind him. He could see the his tracks behind him,
at least a hundred yards, but it was gray and sleeting and couldn't see much
further.

He checked his pockets. Keys in the left hand side. Jacket next: wallet
in the left inside pocket. He pulled out the wallet and went through it.

Driver's license, Maine, "Elliot Martineau".

"Damn I'm ugly," he thought to himself. The picture on the license was an
unpleasant man with bleary eyes, gin blossoms, and what could almost
pass for a beard but more likely the consequence of not having shaved or
showered for several days. Five foot ten, Two hundred thirty pounds.

He gently probed his skull, searching for lumps, tender spots, or bleeding.
No apparent head trauma.

He couldn't remember a damn thing. Not even his own name.

He was on a path and was coming up to a house.

The house had a door, and the door had a lock.

He reached into his pants and pulled out the keys.
He went through the keys one at a time, trying to fit them in the lock.
None of them fit.

He turned the knob and the door opened — it was never locked.

_I'm getting sloppy,_ he thought. _I should have checked first_.

He gently pushed the door open. Dark inside. He eased his way in.

If he hadn't ducked when he saw something out of the corner of his eye the
baseball bat would have caught him square in his face. It clipped
the top of his head instead.

His arm whipped around and grabbed the neck of the man. _Damn I'm fast_.

He lifted the man up, holding him against the wall. _Damn I'm strong_.

There was a sickening cracking noise, and then a sort of squishy
noise. _Too strong. I need to be careful_.

He gently let the man down. He knew without looking the man was
dead. _Wait, that's a woman not a man. Ah, shit._

He looked at her: mid-forties, lean patrician-type. Not a killer. _What was she
doing trying to whack me with a baseball bat? And why did she leave the door
unlocked?_

He looked around. He knew no one else was there, but he methodically searched
each room anyway. Quietly searched. The house was empty.

It appeared that the woman lived here alone: single bed, single toothbrush.

He scanned for food: the woman appeared to be a vegan, and the food wasn't
interesting. Besides, he wasn't hungry.

_I must get going; I have been here too long._

He went through the dressers for clothing, and brought the clothing down and
piled it up in the center of the living room. He checked each label, making sure
it wasn't fire resistant or flame retardant. He lit the corner of the pile and
waited for the fire to catch. Then he left by the back door.

He walked into the woods. _Dammit, where am I going?_

The sleetstorm was turning into a snowstorm, and the woods were hilly.
There was a road in the distance, but he shied away from it for reasons
he couldn't explain. And then he noticed a path. He followed the path to
a house.

This time he checked the door. It was unlocked. He knocked.

A woman in her forties, lean patrician-type, answered.

"I'm sorry," he said.

"About what?" she asked.

"About back there. I mean, never mind."

"Would you like to come in?" she asked.

"Yes, please"

She opened the door wider and let him in. She pointed to a chair. "Why don't you
sit there while I make us some tea?"

"Tea sounds very nice."

He hadn't realized how tired he was, how cold. His clothes were good, and kept
out the cold and the damp, but he had been out for hours.

He was almost nodding off when she came back in.

"Do you take anything with your tea?" she asked.

"No," he said. "Just tea."

"Here you go then." She placed the tea on a small table next to where he sat.

He cupped the tea with hands. It was almost too hot.

"We don't get much men in these parts," she said. "What brings you here?"

"What do you mean, 'not much men'?"

"I mean I haven't seen a man around here in years. Many years."

"What happened to the men?"

She looked at him curiously. "Maybe you should tell me where you're from."

"Where are we anyway?"

"We're outside Portland. Portland, Maine, not Portland, Oregon."

"Hmmm."

"You were saying where you were from?"

"I don't know where I'm from." _Why did I say that? I don't want her to know
anything about me._

"Really? What's the last thing you remember?"

"I was walking along a path." _Christ why can't I shut up?_

She nodded. "And then?"

"A woman tried to kill me with a baseball bat and I accidentally killed
her." _What is happening to me? I need to leave now._

"I'm sorry ma'am, but I think I need to go."

"I think you should stay right here."

That was appealing — it was warm and comfortable in the chair, and he
was beginning to feel sleepy. _Something strange is happening._

"I really need to leave now." With great effort he stood up.

"Oh, I don't think that's what will happen," she said, and pushed him gently in
the middle of the chest, pushing him gently back into the chair. _My strength?
What happened to my strength?_

He fell back into the chair. "What is happening?"

She said, "You've been tranquilized."

"Tranquilized?""

"Let's just say that I put enough in your tea to knock out an elephant. We can't
have men just walking around on their own, can we?"

She gathered up the teacups and went into the kitchen.

With a supreme amount of effort he stood up. He slowly moved to the door. He was
quiet, but not by intent but as a consequence of trying to exert as little energy
as possible. Each step was fatiguing. He was barely able to lift the door handle.
And then he was outside.

He didn't have the energy to go back into the woods. In fact, he barely had
energy to walk ten steps, let alone the twenty it would require to get to the
side of the house. He walked around the side of the house, and gently collapsed
in a snow bank.

He was under the kitchen window, and he could hear her shriek. She must have
realized that he had left. She came back into the kitchen. He could hear her
voice, but couldn't hear whom she was talking to.

"He was right here, but he's gone."

"He shouldn't have been able to get out of the chair, not with the dose I put
in his tea. And believe me, I was generous with the dose — twice the recommended
amount, a reasonable chance of being lethal."

"We can't have a man wandering around — it's not safe. They're dangerous.
They're dangerous to us, to themselves, and to each other. Ever since..."

He couldn't hear the rest; she had walked out of the kitchen.

_I must get out of here._

He willed his legs to move, to sit up, but they wouldn't obey him.

_Partial paralysis; let's hope it doesn't affect the semi-autonomous systems.
I'd like to keep breathing._

He lay in the snow, breathing imperceptibly. He drifted off to sleep.

He noticed the lightness from pre-dawn, the horizon starting to get bright.
Dawn comes quickly, and he needed to get moving quickly. He could move his legs.

_It's still snowing; it'll cover my tracks._

He lurched up and started walking into the woods. It was tempting to collapse
within the woods, but he kept walking.

_Maybe by continuing to move it'll help me shake off the drug faster._

But he doubted it. It didn't matter if he ran a marathon or napped — it was
up to his liver, and his liver worked on its own clock.

At least it wasn't the overwhelming fatigue he had felt last night. Then he was
paralyzed, now he was merely incredibly fatigued. Exhausted.

He tried to remember what had happened yesterday, but the events were blurry.
A side-effect of the tranquilizer, no doubt.

He heard a shout in the distance, and what he thought was barking. A shot of
adrenaline, and he was able to run through the forest. _Not my best time,_ he
thought, _but not bad_. He had run several hundred yards, and the adrenaline
was fading fast.

He felt dizzy. Where was he? He could see through the trees a path. He walked
towards it. Exiting the woods, squinting in the bright light, he began to
walk the path.

_What happened yesterday?_ He couldn't remember. He couldn't remember anything.
He was on a path. Trudging up a path. And it was sleeting. And he couldn't
remember anything that happened more than a minute ago.

The first thing he noticed was the boots, big ugly boots, the kind that rich
people who go skiing use. They were clumsy and ugly, but at least his feet were
warm.
