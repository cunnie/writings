## Robert&rsquo;s Epitaph

<!-- format off --> <p class=&rsquo;poem&rsquo;> A man walking across a field encountered a tiger. He fled, the tiger chasing after him. Coming to a cliff, he caught hold of a wild vine and swung himself over the edge. The tiger sniffed at him from above. Terrified, the man looked down to where, far below, another tiger had come, waiting to eat him. Two mice, one white and one black, little by little began to gnaw away at the vine. The man saw a luscious strawberry near him. Grasping the vine in one hand, he plucked the strawberry with the other. How sweet it tasted! <br /> &mdash;Zen Parable</p> <!-- format on -->

He believed that he could see the bullet speeding towards him, the bullet moving terribly, terribly slowly.  The bullet, in a sense, was his past catching up with him.  

There is this seductive sentiment in America that everyone has the right to a fresh start: that one can simply wipe the debts clean and start over.  That sentiment is reflected in the personal bankruptcy laws but extends beyond finance and into the realm of personal relations.  If one betrays one&rsquo;s friends in Brooklyn, one has the right to move to Los Angeles and become a kind and generous person, and any wrongs done in Brooklyn are wiped clean.

Like many such sentiments (e.g. &ldquo;love conquers all&rdquo;, &ldquo;good always prevails over evil&rdquo;), it can safely be discarded when navigating the world such as it is; it is a false guidepost, one that is wrong as often as it is right, not unlike a Magic Eight Ball in that its purpose is to soothe rather than to counsel.

Robert never believed in a fresh start.  His life was such that he had little room to harbor such illusions.  Robert did have beliefs though; he believed in borrowed time.

Every morning Robert enjoyed his espresso at the coffee house on the corner.

That one particular morning, after returning from the coffee house and just as he was putting the key in the door to his apartment, he knew he had run out of time, for he heard a voice behind him say, &ldquo;thought you could hide, Robert?&rdquo; 

And in those few seconds all Robert could think about was how glad he was that he had put the second sugar cube in the espresso.
