## In Ways You Can Only Imagine

I remember when I first noticed the change within my brother.

We were both sitting around drinking orange juice.  I was looking away, out the window where my neighbors had hung their laundry to dry.  Suddenly my brother blurred out of focus, and then, as quickly as it happened, he snapped back.  I turned to look at him.  And then it happened again.

&ldquo;I think my eyes are tired.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;

&ldquo;You looked blurry there for a second.&rdquo;

My brother shook his head slightly.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your eyes; your eyes are fine.  It&rsquo;s me.  It&rsquo;s an <i>external manifestation</i>.&rdquo;

&ldquo;External manifestation of what?&rdquo;

&ldquo;I&rsquo;m working on a project; I can&rsquo;t talk about it.&rdquo;

My brother worked for a biotech/drug company.  They normally do their own product development, but one project was a contract job for a very secretive customer.  He wasn&rsquo;t allowed to say who the customer was, or what the project involved, but I suspected  the government.

He didn&rsquo;t talk about what the project was, but I knew how to read him.  I grew up with him after all.  An innocent remark about the possibilities of drug therapy to re-engineer the limbic system to make it a sympathetic receptor.

&ldquo;A sympathetic receptor to what?&rdquo; I had asked.  He said he couldn&rsquo;t tell me.

Later he talked about how unimaginative our concept of aliens were. &ldquo;Hollywood did a disservice when it came to portraying aliens, usually bipedal, existing in our environment, breathing our air. Aliens looked just like us, except with pointy ears, or different color skin.  The differences were minimal.&rdquo;

He continued, &ldquo;Gene Rodenberry, when he did Star Trek, once or twice had a flash of brilliance when it came to portraying aliens, but mostly it was fairly pedestrian:  Klingons, Vulcans, Romulans, Ferengi--they all looked like us, more or less.  Same emotions too. Rodenberry was limited by his imagination and his budget.&rdquo;

He suddenly changed topics.  &ldquo;The aliens don&rsquo;t have two feet.  They don&rsquo;t have a physical existence in the way that we do.  They are patterns that exist in certain frequencies.  Certain drugs  can re-engineer the brain to become sensitive to those patterns.&rdquo;

Then he looked at me, &ldquo;And they are different than us.  Very different.  Motives?  They don&rsquo;t even have what might be described as motives.  The way they think...it&rsquo;s so completely foreign.&rdquo;

He looked down.  &ldquo;There are things I wish I could tell you.&rdquo;

We sat there for a minute, not saying anything.


The next time I saw him I had to go to his office.  They made me sign papers, most of them were Department of Homeland Security forms, telling me I could never talk about what I saw here, and telling me what would happen to me if I did talk about it.  Then an armed soldier led me to my brother&rsquo;s room.  It was a fishbowl room, with several people in lab coats in the next room watching, making notes.

&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t leave the this place anymore,&rdquo; he told me.  &ldquo;The changes are too obvious for the general public.&rdquo;

I looked at him.  He started blurring, and then suddenly became normal again.

&ldquo;I have a hard time staying here.  I try, but sometimes I start slipping to the other place.&rdquo;

&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve terminated the experiment.  I think the whole project is on hold until they figure out what&rsquo;s going on with me.  They haven&rsquo;t given me the drugs for a month, but it&rsquo;s still getting worse, not better.&rdquo;

&ldquo;You know there won&rsquo;t be a body--I won&rsquo;t leave anything behind when I go. I don&rsquo;t know how much longer I can stay here.  It&rsquo;s so hard staying, and it keeps getting harder, and I&rsquo;m not strong enough.  And once I&rsquo;m gone I won&rsquo;t come back, so there will have to be a funeral.  I guess put some ashes or something in a can, I mean an urn.  I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;

This time, Instead of blurring, he became shifting planes of light.  Then snapped back to himself.  He winced.

&ldquo;That was a hard one.&rdquo;

&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it like?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Imagine that you are yourself, and then suddenly you are something completely different, but you can sort of remember who you were, maybe it&rsquo;s something small, like remembering the taste of orange juice.  So you don&rsquo;t let that go, you hold on to that thing, whatever it is.  And then you pull at it, so that you can remember other things, like maybe the color of orange juice, and then you can remember colors, and tastes, and sounds, and then suddenly you&rsquo;re back to being you again.&rdquo;

He took a deep breath.  &ldquo;But remembering that stuff, pulling at that stuff--it&rsquo;s like pulling yourself up Mount Everest on a rope.  It&rsquo;s unbelievably exhausting.&rdquo;

He nodded towards the scientists on the other side of the glass. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t figure out what it is.  When I transform, their instruments go crazy.  I radiate unbelievably strong, in all sorts of different wavelengths.  My absorption levels are nothing they&rsquo;ve ever seen. They suspect that I&rsquo;m even absorbing neutrinos, but of course they can&rsquo;t really test that.&rdquo;

I wanted to say something, but my brother and I both grew up under fairly adverse circumstances, so neither of us had much tolerance for bullshit.  Saying something like, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry, they&rsquo;ll figure it out,&rdquo; would have pissed him off.

He looked at the scientists again.  &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t figure it out.  They don&rsquo;t have enough time, and even if they had more time, and they did figure out what was going on, they probably wouldn&rsquo;t be able to fix it anyway.&rdquo;

He turned back towards me.  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have much time left.  Hours maybe.  If I&rsquo;m lucky, a day.&rdquo;

He slumped.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too tired.  I can&rsquo;t fight much longer.&rdquo;

I noticed the circles under his eyes, the paleness of the skin.  I had never seen him so tired.

And then he started shimmering.

Shimmering is a poor way to describe what was happening.  It was similar to the way moonlight shimmers over water: flickering, parts were bright, parts were dark.

I waited for him to snap back, but he didn&rsquo;t.  I noticed that the scientists in the other room were very excited, running around and adjusting their instruments.

I was dimly aware of my hands hurting from gripping the chair.

He must have been fighting very hard because the shimmering went on for minutes, and then, just as quickly as it started, it stopped.

And there was nothing.
